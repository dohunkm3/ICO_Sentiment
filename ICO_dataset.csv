Very excited about this partnership. There is lots of potential as the product is easily portable to other events/streams. Looking forward to seeing it in action very soon!  Don't forget to spread the word: https://twitter.com/KarlKarlsson_/status/1057297616684437505,pos
really love ur project and ur idea! good success guys!,pos
https://www.kochiesbusinessbuilders.com.au/new-reward-program-employs-blockchain-technology/  very nice news! go Incent!,pos
Cheers my friend for a great investment concept . Good job for creating opportunities as this. I really like the creativity of this business being on a blockchain. Tends to be faster and more secure.,pos
I think you will break 1000 bitcoin in the fundraising. Pretty good for this project. Good luck team.,pos
"   Great news everyday, more and more ppl notice the project, congratulations.",pos
That's good to hear. I invested some BTC for this project and I'm hoping that it will bring successful outcome in the coming months. The concept of this project is so good and it only boils down to the project team whether this will be a success or will flop in the long run.,pos
Good news for incent...  https://due.com/blog/four-sectors-blockchain-point-changing/  Rewards sector is clearly a good place to be in right now.,pos
I'm happy that I joined the Incent signature campaign so that I can get some bounty. And I will hold this token for long term!  I also joined ICO of course!,pos
"Congrats on the partnership incent... well done guys. Good news for incent holders, the ICO and the crypto world in general. keep up the good work.",pos
Great. Almost 1m raised.  Good job guys!,pos
"   boom!  day 1 participant because of exactly THIS  ""Partnership with Smea will give Incent the means to expose tens of thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians to the power of ‘open value’, that crypto-currency makes possible.""  Rob, you & your team are doing a great job thus far  feeling like there is much more to come, what a wonderful business",pos
"  This is really another exciting news by Incent,I am glad to have invested in incent",pos
"  That is amazing and very good news for us.I am sure some huge money flow will come within the few days and we'll fill the ICO cap before the timeline,no doubt about it.Great work dev team.",pos
"   Incent connects to 30,000 Australian Businesses this is very very Great news Sir ",pos
Seems like everything is going well so far.,pos
"  Yeah, i hope soo. the trader will jump to incent, i believe this coin will be greats potential coins.",pos
Everyday day I'm on this thread things just keep looking better and better. Can't wait for the official release. This project is just great! great work devs... keep at it.,pos
"Looks like an interesting project to begin with, devs deserved the hype and popularity.",pos
"   Two things. The lead developer on Komodo, James, has a large and loyal following. In fact, the funding incorporated the entire community of BTCD owners as well.  Meanwhile, Incent is launching upon Waves, and Waves hasn't officially been launched yet. So naturally, a lot of people are waiting to see if Waves delivers on its promises. Once this is confirmed, I think you will see a lot of money flowing into the Incent ICO.  I have a strong feeling that Rob Wilson will be making some big partnership announcements over the next 40 days as well.  I have always felt that this particular ICO, for a lot of reasons, could bring in a lot of money in the last week or two of its running.  That is why current prices are still very very cheap. Its also why I invested 500% more in Incent than I did in Komodo. And I have known James for 3 years.",pos
Great going Incent.It is going to take the world by storm,pos
this is a great news. Implementing a referral system can  help this a  lot to make more people aware of it and get more investors. and it gives benefit to the the affliate marketers also.. really a good improvement.,pos
I put my largest portion into incent...... I will be rich very soon. It is a feeling I get in my loins,pos
Great to see all this positive publicity around Incent. You guys have a lot of pressure to live up to,pos
Great article... thanks for posting. I think its fair to say based on this article that incent are definitely moving in the right direction.,pos
This spells great things to come!,pos
"   the viral exchange just blew up my mind. what a awesome opportunity for good-crypto, great choice doing the bounty campaign on this nice project (http://theviralexchange.com/).   EDIT ///  sorry I'm out after seeing awful permissions ",neu
Just got some incent good luck to the team and investors.,pos
"It looks like this project is really having a great mission and goals, so many investors are interested in investing.",pos
"The ICO is going very well, really promising project !!:)",pos
"Just a quick update after some bitcoin blockchain display issues overnight, now patched... looking forward to some new dashboard updates today, and looking forward to pushing the word out ahead of the imminent price rise!",pos
"   I follow the news on the blog and post here, incent has great ability. We hope more businessmen who could join to become a partner. Congrats and Good jobs team incent",pos
"   Dev you are very good at expanding the business, congrats, now so many partners so far, incent will explode.",pos
"   Yes, I think this is a very powerful idea. The nice thing is, no one needs to ask permission to use Incent - they would just download the plugin and get started.",pos
One thing I lilke of Incent are the shopify + magento plugins that the team will build. This gives more chances to indipendent online stores over Amazon.,pos
"   Incent team is very transparent, they show identities and CV, and they are all real people. RW is bitscan CEO, which is one of the most popular bitcoin media site. They must a very reliable team.",pos
You cant compare crap coin to incent people. Incent is working project before it even steps out the gate after ICO. Who is offering that to you ? What other ICO's are working now ? You also need to questions who the devs are and how capable are they in finishing a project... without getting ADD and moving to something else. Incent is a working platform with a working idea that most businesses would like to join.,pos
Yeah I agree you can see there if poeple very intersted about this project  https://blockchain.info/address/3EcZsF2GSYfBM6YNRJ7RAEuRhqLBhFRcdY  http://wavesexplorer.com/address/3PNkrUsJcrNFWsnTrbz2pLiH7nE8xEpHbnA So far...Well dont be miss out this a great project,pos
and I believe the dev team is already working well. Because that many people invest to incent good luck,pos
"   Wow, that is great news! Incent looking really good",pos
"I already join ico, I hope the future this coin a good such as pesobit high price of up to 3000% of the price of ico ",pos
It's so good to see synergistic partnerships finally take the lead in the crypto sphere.   The last few years have been such a cockfight of devs and ideas.  Maybe we are finally getting back to working together and making the blockchain something that unite us.,pos
"  Yes, we are very happy with how the ICO is going ",pos
"the project is so hot,so many friend is join it",pos
good project,pos
psb really got big support and i hope Incent will do the same as we all happy with those previous ico at least not just a pnd and it have good result after hitting exchange good luck Incent make us happy too guys.,pos
yes mate the progress showing good indication and i see another successful ico project right after stratis and psb. good luck.,pos
great movement,pos
Joined signature campaign. Go Incent!,pos
"I am very excited for Incent. Finally a real world use for a crypto token. And on WAVES, which I am already invested in!",pos
Yeah I dont quite understand the low interest in this ICO i can see great potential here... and best of all it seems like there is a great team behind this really pushing for success.,pos
this is huge and can change the way we think about merchant-backed loyalty. will follow this,pos
Incent will be one of the best ICO projects for 2016.,pos
"   Rob seems like an experienced CEO, i am confident about your project. Keep watching this thread.",pos
Thanks Rob - this was a gruelling and informative interview which you passed with flying colours.  Can you explain how INCENT/Bitscan derives profit from this?  Where are the stages you take your cut?  cheers,pos
Incent will be really big project! I am glad to be on a board of this ship,pos
I've just joined the signature campaign. hope its not too late for me. I like the idea of this token so hope to have a fortune one day. does Waves and incent have common developer?,pos
"For some reason, I feel really confident in this project (not sure if it's the team, the concept, or a combination). Anyways, good luck with Incent!",pos
"I just bought some Incent using BTC. I guess I missed some Incent from the first batch of sale but there's a saying that goes like ""better late than never."" Will definitely buy more in the coming days and will support this project. Good luck Incent Team. ",pos
"WOW, very promising interview.    Rob, I love your vision.  I will support Incent, thats for sure. You'r a good guy, good in heart, good for the whole crypto movement. keep it up.  the interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ugRsEDClU",pos
Nice Project.. Good luck @all,pos
"Hey folks, nice project though.  One question. Is it ok to withdrawal $btc from exchange to Incent ICO BTC address or MUST I own the BTC wallet private key (e.g. trezor hw wallet, bitcoin core wallet)?  Thanks for details",pos
I would have skipped this ICO. But I'm glad I invested in the 1st round thanks to this great article (german) https://altcoinspekulant.wordpress.com/2016/09/30/incent-interessantes-ico-startet-am-samstag/,pos

This is good news for the investors. would be happy if you could work out a google hangout soon. it can be a major boost to the Incent project!,pos
Re-tweeted  and congrats for your new found partnership,pos
I believe this is another great project that will be undervalued at first but bring huge profits for investors like Stratis did. You guys should seriously do a Google hangout session so everyone can see just how legit and innovative this project is going to be.,pos
Okay will check soon.Best of luck Incent. i'll invest something since its related to waves. thank you,pos
Looking good to reach the goal of 1 Mill. Dollar,pos
ICO Incent  NIce  good projeck,pos
"   They do. But what you have to realize is that if you invest in a really good project and other people miss the opportunity, you're ROI is going to be much higher once everyone hears about it.",pos
"Wow, Awesome service, I would like to get this for my business to. What kind of charges and fees to you take?",pos
"   Thanks Mrdeeds! Very exciting times, especially with the news of the first business partner.",pos
Hi there everyone. Now we had the Waves Ico and we are all waiting for it to take off this is another great opportunity to invest in a promising startup.

👍👍👍  Looking forward to hearing more over by next few weeks about the others clients that are approaching you.,pos
That's exciting news. I would assume this company has tens of thousands of customers?,pos
I am very hopeful Incent will takeoff as a first mover in the loyalty space. They need to pepper proof of concept stories (video interviews) that represent success stories.,pos
"nice project ,i'm in.",pos
I like the fact that it's  'crowdale' launching.... actually sounds better than a crowd sale,pos
great！it is good job.,pos

I am waiting for the bounties to be announced. Plus I am waiting for the reply of my PM to you.",pos
"   We are really happy to hear it, thanks ",pos
i hope someday i will see this alt in the TOP 100 coin at coinmarketcap and break the past high price again because i see the team active to develop this project and a lot of great things coming to this project,pos
"I just red the walpaper and I'm impressed. This is very close to how I imagine the both fast and scalable blockchain. However, after tortureing  Dmitry on Discord with questions, now I have more of them   1. In whitepaper you are speaking of proxy nodes and data storage nodes. Can I run such nodes, or they are regular nodes which are used with these special purpouse only?  2. After I register on Metagather.org and claim the free 1000 lended coins for forging (your word for staking), can I receive also more coins if my node is proxy or storage type?  3. If I run a full wallet, do I receive more coins? (is there an option to run a full node?)  4. When I registered it, I never received a private key for my wallet. Just a public one and a file which I don't know what do do with. Is it some kind of replacement of private key and if yes, can it be used via other, different wallet software?  4. The MHC coin is perfect for mobile devices, android TV boxes, old tablets, phones, Raspberry PIs and various IoT devices. Since it is not mining, it does not put stress on such devices so it can run peacefully on them.  Do you plan releasing software for Android platform?  5. Mobile wallet?  6. How can I find out what type of node I have?  a) Core b) Verification c) Peer  7. Please simplify the navigation of the wallet interface and add an uptime timer.",neu
i think i prefer this cryptocurrency than Apollo. it looks faster in transaction. please what is the process of donating an idle machine to your network in other earn more Metahash?,pos
"look like this project is quite interesting, because the team member is active to give all informations about this project anyway, where i can see the future plan or roadmap from this project ?",pos
I love metahash,pos
"If our coins are really good We should open the game Our market is still very small Very little marketing advertising I don't understand. I suppose that if the metahash project is owned by Justin Sun, what do he do now? I love metahash sincerely",pos
Now we are ranked at 1800 in coinmarketcap.I love metahash,pos
I love metahash,pos
"  i'm happy regarding this news, i just hope they don't delay the exchange listing and list on any exchange that is reputable.",pos
This project is really good and meaningful. It is well worth the short and long term investment. Follow and retweet done.,pos

I love metahash,pos
Sounds interesting. How can I use it?,pos
"Yeah, so interesting. And fresh news here!",pos
" I think this project has a great concept. It has also good capability in its field. I red it does more than 100,000 transactions every second on each node. very nice performance.",pos
"   I got my reward, thanks team! In my opinion, it seems obvious that the MetaHash system expects a promising growth since the launch of all rounds of the program.",pos
"it looks good and impressive, everything is ready to function very well in the future, and I think this team is very detailed to give a lot of notes on every product made",pos
Now it is clear why people have recognized the value of the idea. At least it looks like they have. But some of it's due to it being a really useful business that can have global implications.,pos
"   Quite unique in Metahash management, surely holders will feel safe with this method. Applications that are quite interesting and this will not bring the holder to loss and loss, be careful in using Metahash because it has node security.",pos
"Strong ""roster"" you have! The whole core idea sounds pretty ambitious as well. Am I right in understanding that your tech can be used to decentralized basically any service out there?",pos
"The project has a strong team of specialists and a number of world-class advisers. A big plus for the company is the presence of serious technological developments, extensive team work experience in the field and unique technology of blocking 4.0 which will be a seriously saves time for its users.",pos
"This is a terrific project, Round A is over, is there anything else? I read that this coin has a PoS system,  I downloaded the metahash client, but there I did not find the possibility of a PoS / PoW or is it not realized yet?  good team work !",pos
I support this project and I hope that it will be useful! When will the campaign end? Or has it already ended?,pos
Great technology application and great vision i would say. It is a head above the rest of the so call fastest transaction chain that seem to be the norm thing now.,pos
"congratulations to Metahash who have completed the ICO, The Bounty must be very happy because ICO is running smoothly and is happy to receive gifts from their hard work during this time. I see that Metahash is going to be a huge project and of course good for the future.",pos
The project is becoming more popular every day. There is a high probability that the project will become a market leader. Your idea is very interesting and will surely benefit for all mankind. This project must be recommended to crypto enthusiast.,pos
"Many are lucky with the prizes that you offer, this is certainly a bounty participant feel happy and participate in quality with your assessment. A quality project will certainly be a big project and will develop well for the future. Congratulations on the amazing performance of the Metahash team.",pos
I am looking forward to details of forging as i want to setup a node,pos
App with decentralization blockchain is amazing,pos
Five million transactions a day is no mean feat. A solid well-laid out ecosystem from a far-reaching vision. Good luck.,pos
They have an MVP and they will release a mobile app soon. Really like the idea behind MetaHash and am bullish on anything that enables DAPP development and maintenance.,pos
"I'm fascinated. Amazzing job, another interesting work. I saw an example of Bob and Alice. I'm wondering what bonus Bob will receive due to the fact that he delegated tokens?",pos
"This project is really great, and your site and panel definitely stand out. Very good!",pos
"There's plenty of room for distributed applications, and the future of Metahash is still something investors can look forward to and participate in holding the coin.",pos
They have an oversubscribed private round which is a sign of a great start. They have a strong technology which they are confident of.,pos
This project is intended to mak a high impact change at blockchain. This may great help to lot of non-technology company.,pos
Really good results. Well let's look at the same results six months after the launch of the entire system. But how much time needed for generating an irreversible block?,pos
"In my opinion, The fact that the key component of the TraceChain network is built on the routing protocol already shows that the company has focused on using artificial intelligence for the fastest signal transmission. This is an innovative step that has already brought us closer to an entirely new branch of development of the block system.",pos
"The project developers, of course, understand that we live in the days of incredible development of science and technology. Things that have long been considered science fiction, are becoming real. I think that's why they decided to create MetaHash, the next generation network based on Blockchain 4.0 technology, which will be used to exchange digital assets and as a platform for creating and managing decentralized applications in real time. Very cool project!",pos
"You have a very pleasant business, impeccable activity, an apperceptive approach! Tell me please, what is the size of the block and how often it is generated?",pos
"The Metahash project team is doing solid work and is technically strong, and the Metahash coin is an encrypted currency that is worth investing in for a long time.",pos
"Good project right here I have this question for you, though – are there any bonuses? Any bonuses at all? What do I need to do to get a bonus? I think here are the same as I like freebies",pos
Modern trends always support diversity and flexibility. A very good team with a well-built and well-prepared project. Tracechain can be widely applied in dealing with enormous masses per second. Mainnet is ready for excitement.,pos
"There are high performance gears on this project, good job devs.",pos
very interesting !,pos
The Metahash project has an innovative idea on blockchain. There is a high probability that the project will become a market leader. Your idea is very interesting and will surely benefit for all!,pos
"  Interesting thoughts. Usually projects think quite differently) But I agree with you. We should not think about money and speculation, but about a quality ready-made platform. Then success will come.",pos
"his is a very promising company #Metahash , which is waiting for a great future! I think you will make the right choice by joining this campaign!",pos
Your team is doing the right thing.,pos
i definatly want to be a part of this project. on the site they say that there is also a bounty program for it. can someone put a link to it?,pos
"For all technical complexity, MetaGate is much easier for the user than conventional crypto currency.",pos
Unprecedented speed and decentralization of the #TraceChain network make #MetaHash the flagship of Blockchain - I'm supporting this idea of Blockchain 4.0 technology for sharing digital assets,pos
"I wish good luck for the idea. Seamless website, cognitive website, engaging project!",pos
"The project has a strong team of specialists and a number of world-class advisers. A big plus for the company is the presence of serious technological developments, extensive team work experience in the field and unique technology of blocking 4.0 which will be a seriously saves time for its users.",pos
Blockchain has brought about revolution in all the sectors. I'm in love with this and I will be supporting it,pos
ICO finishes when? I am interested in this project and want to know where I can talk to the team about mass collaboration.,pos
"The plan is very nice and if you truly get on in realizing your plans, then I suppose it will be good.",pos
"Hello, Amazing project! It's so awesome!! just received my first token, still didn’t download wallet, can I send already ETH to do a new buy or do I have to withdraw first the ones I got?",pos
"I support this plan and trust  it can be useful! Very great idea, attentive project!  Good luck fellows!",pos
"  The project looks promising to me there are lot professional on blockchain platform on the team. Any airdrop or bounty campaigns like a signature campaign, social media campaign that the team is planning to launch soon?",pos
OK I see everything is possible!!,pos
"I wish you success. Impeccably plan, a rather interesting website, thoughtful activity!",pos
"   That sounds like a good starting point depending on where it goes, that's about all I'm going to buy initially. Do you reckon it would be worth buying double that amount with 2 ETH? If this version takes off who knows what it could materialize?",pos
"I like your business. Engaging idea, mindful plan, unblemished approach.",pos
"If the project follows the road map, then soon we will see a rapid growth of tokens. For this I think to buy a bit on the stock exchange. I hope I can make good money on it. I will follow the news",pos
"The plan is very nice and if you really thrive in actualizing your ideas, then I suppose it will be interesting.",pos
"Looking for something above amusing here! Pretty good website, thoughtful results!  Good luck guys!",pos
I have tested all the points of your project and all is really very useful.,pos
"Hi, i'm looking forward at your project. What will be the minimum participation amount for round A?",pos
"Another great idea based on the Blockchain 4.0 technology, the team are full of blockchain expert. Promising project i will support.",pos
I commend you for your amazing project. Blockchain 4.0 is indeed a great idea. High speed and low cost transactions in conjunction with being scale-able is definitely what people are looking for in the crypto world. I wish you good luck in your coin sale!,pos
Interesting proyect,pos
I like that #MetaHash is decentralized. This allows anyone to add transaction nodes to the network #MetaHash,pos
"MetaHash is a meaningful project in the real world. It can be said that when using this platform, the storage capacity, transaction speed and diversity of digital assets are best protected in transactions. I am very confident in the project.",pos
"Blockchain 4.0 is surely twisting anything around. With it's advantages, will take the cryptocurrency world to a new level. And it should be more convenient for transaction purposes.",pos
"I read about the project and found that MetaHash is a digital asset exchange network with a speed of ""100,000 transactions per second on each node."" The project also outlines how to make that great speed. At the same time, all asset types can be #MetaHashCoin for low cost. I am very impressed with MetaHash.",pos
"well.. In my opinion, Metahash has a cool idea to use the Blockchain 4.0 technology, to share digital assets and its a platform while managing and making the decentralized apps/services. You get a right way to become a successful project later on. I can see a promising chance to have many investors here. good luck ",pos
To get and interesting project as this one can be really exiting. So where will the ICO started? Is there any bounty campaign held during the ICO?,pos
"After reading this ANN of Metahash and Visited its official site, I think this project has a great concept. It has also good capability in its field. I red it does more than 100,000 transactions every second on each node. very nice performance. I'll stay tuned to know the development of this project and pay attention to the bounty program.      ",pos
"looks good, and everything is ready to function well in the future, I think the team is very detailed giving lots of notes on every product made",pos
"The concept is to bring about infrastructure for the progress of the people's economy, actually a very good concept like this because the benefits will be felt directly by the community because economic growth will be very profitable for a country",pos
"I found this project quite good, professional development team, the plan is given in a very detailed white paper! This is a very trusting project!",pos
"  It would be great, I'll keep tokens until their price goes sky-high! Great project and team!",pos
"  I agree that the project is good for the long term, the future is impossible without bots in trading, all will be improved, the demand for automated trading will only grow",pos
very good project dev and whether in this project will be held bunty or signature for project development good job it is project,pos
i agree with you. if you like project and active dev then why not support for long. NaPoleonX is good team. They are very transparent and talking to community,pos
"  really good news for Napoleon project, when this authoritative publication as Forbes published an article about Napoleon, this means only one - success for the project is guaranteed",pos
"Good job team Nice try, Good luck, guys! well, goodluck to your ICO and may this project prosper.",pos
"   yes, the forbes article will obviously boost this project as well as its reputation will rise along it getting more huge investors on board.  cant wait to buy some tokens",pos
"I also think that NapoleonX is the best project in crypto asset management. The Daf system is really disruptive and the team will offer us a well developed platform. The algorithm for each Daf will be very powerfull, I think that the benefit from NapoleonX will be incredible.",pos
"   I didn't know about forbes, so if that is the case, then NaPoleonX is a very good long-term investment, and thanks to the delay, now we have more time for people to realize how good this is and bring their investments as well .",pos
Haha I'm smiling because this is just soooo great!  I'm sure this project will be huge when the ICO will go live. A lot of new investors will join crypto's because of this project. Huge stock investors will come to crypto to invest in this project!  This will be great for NapoleonX and ETH. I'm convienced that the price of ETH will raise because of this project.,pos
"   Well, it's becoming more and more interesting. Happy to be here since the beginning of the ANN, it's quite sure that I will invest now.",pos
This is just amazing news and even better for marketing since reader base is huge. I guess partnership Chaineum is already paying off and th decision for postponing ICO was a good one.,pos
"   I read it. This is an authoritative publication, the mention of which will benefit NapoleonX. So the project will be successful. Without doubt, it makes sense to invest in it.",pos
That's definitely huge! With an article mentioning NapoleonX in the Forbes magazine the project will get the attention it deserves.,pos
Great news. The appearance of a mention in a publication of this level will surely attract new followers. This is a very good help for the development of the project.,pos
"   Not necessarily, but undoubtely appearing in Forbes - either their website or their printed resources - is something great.",pos
"  I agree with you, the project will show itself as soon as the bots begin to bring a stable profit.",pos
Yes it’d true that NapoleonX is very active. They are always somewhere in an event to talk about the project. The communication and marketing are awesome and powerfull. NapoloenX will start the pre sale very well with a lot of attention. A great job from the team.,pos
"   They have indeed an impressive portfolio, let's hope they can help NapoleonX in the same way to reach its goals.",pos
"   It's gonna be alright. the team is making great moves and forming partnerships. this takes time, but will benefit the project in the long run.",pos
Very nice! I think that is a smart idea since the project itself might be a bit hard for a lot of people to grasp. I'm still hoping for an infograph to clarify how everything works.,pos
"  Very much agree, a ""slowly but surely move"" is always a better action than those made within a ""in a hurry"" situation.",pos
This is great news guys! Very nice partnership. This will attract more investors . Cant wait what the next announcement is!  Now I have to wait a little longer for investing in NapoleonX But I'm sure its worth the wait!,pos
"I am so impatient to see your trading bot. What is very cool on your project is that you will often create new bots. Without this of course your concept will be very poor but that's not the case so perfect. Another good point is that the community will be able to vote for the best bots, we can see here all the power of the blockchain.",pos
"    It would be great, I'm quite sure this will be a good one, and I'll invest some BTC in it.",pos
"   I think NapoleonX will be much better! The DAF's are created for you with the best algo, you can change a lot on those other bots to loose a lot of money instead of gaining  I think I know the winner of this bot world war",pos
nice project.  i like it,pos
"I want to say that NaPoleonX has a great bounty manager! compared to other projects - tables are filled in time, and everything is arranged in them if the project has a good attitude towards to bounty - then project itself will prosper!",pos
"Wow! 2500 bounty program is big and for sure many people join to your bounty. I would like to join also but I have joined to the campaign who still running. But anyway , october 23 is start of ICO and for sure many investor will invest to napleonx so it will become successful this project. I will also invest in napleonx and im very excited ICO start in october 23.",pos
the ambitious project is very good and they have an impressive soft cap goal if it was obtained I'm sure it would be a good start,pos
Awesome video! I'm gonna share this on my social media accounts. Who knows - maybe it will bring new investors?,pos
"A good Ico, I will be happy if everything ends as intended. When will the project be finished?",pos
this project is so good so I think it can get 100k ETH like Centra ICO had done.,pos
i really like the way devs support that channel,pos
just take a simple look at the project an this thread - it is really cool- and if you have questions just ask. the devs answer real quick,pos
Very nice video guys! I loved the little fact about Goldman Sachs replacing almost all employees with bots. Really shows that this is the direction the big boys are taking and that crypto should use this as well.,pos
"A very proactive team, who answers all the questions, many references in the economic press. Seems a very promising future for Napoleon X",pos
"Solid project with a very good name Till when will the pre slae 30% bonus be active? I am thinking about investing, but i have no acces to my wallet at the moment, due to travel. I will have acces in about two weeks, hopefully I can still get the bonus or I will have to ask a friend to invest for me",pos
Yeah certainly looks that way. Good to see enthusiasm for this project.,pos
This is very encouraging indeed. I expect a good number of investors will come from this. keep up the good work.,pos
"   Very nice to see you guys mentioned on cointelegraph, that will attract some more people to get. Good thing i already signed up for the pre-sale ",pos
Many are afraid to enter and many are afraid to do day trading. NaPoleonX will be helpful in overcoming everyone's fear.,pos
"  Yes they are very active,They response quickly on slack too.I think the tean is really good and when my friend suggested me to join their signature,I quickly agreed.Going to invest in ICO too and I want as many NPX as I can get",pos
"The project is unique on the market, and this is what the market will conquer. Many investors are afraid to enter crypto-currencies due to high risks, but this project is a great opportunity to secure their money and make a profit.",pos
"The marketing of NapoleonX is really great, as the communication, just look at the thread, we are a lot to support the project and want to be in a part of NapoleonX. And the team is really active, all questions are answered fastly and the team is really transparent. Its really important for the sucess of the project, napoleonx will do great things, big hope and opportunity here !",pos
"   I really hope this project is too big, I'll try to invest some $$$. Must reach at least the soft cap",pos
Every project should speak for itself and NapolenX in my opion does this perfectly. They've got very big and active community so there souldn'y be any problems with ICO,pos
"I am liking what i see in here, linkedin links and everything seems to be in order. Still have to read your whitepaper before i go to sleep.",pos
Yes I think the market needs an algorithmic crypto asset manager. It will help many bond market investors to come into the crypto world.,pos
Nice to see the Community growing here!,pos
"Still a month out from the start of the ICO but looks like this is taking off..  Great communication from the team.  Looking forward to seeing the beta (glad to see you are taking the security concerns seriously before putting something out).  Also, love that this can trade outside of crypto.. it can draw in a much larger audience if something more commonplace is traded such as gold or stocks.",pos
"Wow, this sounds interesting. I'll keep a close eye on it.",pos
"  it's worth it, the project is really good, I also joined to bounty company in social networks, because I believe in their success and I want to follow all the news of this project !",pos
"   Really a project to fill the eyes of connoisseurs of good opportunities, this one has everything to take off soon and be the basis for other projects. I believe in the potential of the Team and in the success of ICO. Good luck to everyone",pos
I really like the concept of this Project NapoleonX will benefit from 85% of all performance fees generated by the various DAFs and 100% of the performance on its participation in these vehicles.,pos
"We are a lot to enjoy NapoleonX and to be impatient to see and use the platform. I think the project will be a nice sucess, there is a lot of possibility with an algorithmic crypto asset manager and a lot of benefit to make ! The ico will raise a lot of money, the team manage the communication very welll, all questions are answered and you can't ask anything you want on a lot of social network like slack or telegram. Its really important for investors and NapoleonX tea do it greatly !",pos
Awesome news and thanks for quick update! Now I'm almost sure that I'll invest heavily in this ICO!,pos
"   I have to give respect when due, but this is one of the most responsive community manager I have seen on this forum. it's great.",pos
"   yeah, I really like the way the dev's communicate here. I've seen answer after answer and plenty of clarifications. really well done.",pos
i am expecting NaPoleonx will be best ICO for invest in October  17.,pos
This kind of things will always bring some big investors which is essential to raise enough funding to make it real.  Good work napoleonx.,pos
"   This is a project worthy of follow-up to the entire Crypto community, it will simply revolutionize the way you do business and make a profit, no doubt worth the investment, congratulations to the NapoleonX team for your continued efforts.",pos
"The NapoleonX Daf system can disrupt the way some people invest in crypto. At the beginning we will have the choice between 10 different DAF, with different setting and purpose. Daf system will make huge benefit in crypto market, if things continue to go this well for crypto,the napoleonX algorithmic asset  manager will generate a huge amount of money.",pos
"     Nice, this looks promising. Can't wait for future news, especially about the strategies employed.",pos
"    I really like these type of projects. I've invested some in Iconomi and SIFT. So far i'm not too impressed by Iconomi though, and i wish NaPoleonX had started their ICO earlier  Even though i like to trade some myself, i know i'm not the best and would be happy to let a bot do it for me to increase my profits. No hassle of having to watch all the news and indicators yourself, but just let automation make you rich ",pos
Really think NaPoleonX wont be having any problems reaching that hidden cap. This project is solid and so is the team. Really active devs here in this thread. None of the questions stays unanswered. This gives people trust and trust is what big investors look for these days.  Great work team!,pos
Some nice words Trrrt Seen a lot of successfull ICO's this year and really hope NaPoleonX will be one of them. This project is really getting the traction it deserves.  Cant wait to see it go to the moon!,pos
"   I was wondering the same but, the difference is inthe the team, if you look these people have quite a lot of experience in the field. Secondly they clearly provide data, see the blackpaper.",pos
"The NapoleonX team participate to a lot of event its very cool for the visibility and they will continue to do it. They also have visibility with some article about the project, people really enjoyed it. We will see a huge community around the project in few days, if things continue like that we will see one of the most sucessfull ico of the year with NapoleonX.",pos
"   You guys look like some serious professionals, i like it I once saw a picture of the SIA team and immediately sold all my SIA  But in all seriousness, it is clear you guys know your stuff. Looking forward to some blogs/vlogs after the summit.",pos
"your project looks interesting, and will go to da moon, so I'm in, allez allez",pos
Potential for grow is huge. If community will support this project people will invest and everybody will benefit from ICO,pos
After reading and following the thread. It looks like the community is really looking forward to this project. Thank you for those who simplified it and i'll definitely watch the ICO,pos
"   its enough to convince me to get coins soon! Great, revolutionary, project!",pos
"The current scenario accurately reflects the great usefulness and application of this concept, the lack of control by inexperienced and anxious people during devaluation, shows that the bots of this project will be very useful and will allow us to have more control and profits in those moments. An excellent investment for our future investments",pos
"    It's a good strategy, i am aware that the conferences that you are participating very prestigious.  i hope you get it then. As a small investor, when the time come, i will make a contribituon",pos
"Yes napoleonX is a great opportunity for people who haven't the time to manage all their invest or people with a lack of knowledge. They will start with a DAF with low risk on napoleonX, and they will generate an income. Its really nice. The project is very solid and the communication of the team is really huge, all questions are answered here.",pos
Yes its the good moment to buy eth at a good price in you want to join NapoleonX. And it will be worth your invest. Remember the potential of a dividend token. NapoleonX will generate a lot of benefit when DAF will be launched.,pos
That sounds great. It good that you have this experience to bring to the table. It seems the project is in good hands.,pos
yeah you right. Napoleonx concept is good and team is hardworking. i think can raised fund for this project.,pos
i just want to say great work to every body and  all the work everybody is doing to get this coin moving,pos
"very interesting project start of ico is 23 october so i have enough time to lern more about this project,30% bonus on pre-sale is good for me...",pos
Good to see active devs to clear the doubts. Like the idea of DAF.,pos
Interesting and very necessary project.,pos
"NapoleonX team is really really active. They handle the project very nicely and the communication part too. The slack and the telegram is very active, team take the time to reply to everyone and ervey question. You don't see that with a lot of project. NapoleonX start to build a great community around a huge project. Its pretty nice !",pos
Interesting project ! Good to see french people here 🇫🇷  Bonne chance !,pos
"The more I look into it, the more the project seems solid.  The team seems to have great experience, and I already heard about it in France by some friends.  I saw you'll be in the Zurich Summit tomorrow, that's some great news.",pos
"Great that there is an active dev here on the thread answering all the questions! That will give some trust to all possible investors.  I joined the translation campaign, so cant wait to dig into that Whitepaper and to know all about this great project! Trading bots are so cool",pos
much better thank you. this project is certainly interesting and worth watching.,pos
"     Thank you for your explanation.  I have been lots of icos thread, first time i saw a dev that give very detailed answers to every question. I want to thank you for that too. It makes me think, i chose a right ico to invest.",pos
So far the idea looks promising. Will there be a more ellaborated whitepaper and a demo on the platform?,pos
"Glad to see NapoleonX, I follow the projet since July and enjoyed it so much. Trading bot is a nice feature, can be very powerful and make a lot of money. I love the idea to bypass the traditional asset management system, its old a new system need to emerge. The Daf seems to have a good chance to revolutionate the way we invest, its disruptive and i like that. You also will give vote to nxt holders, wich is very nice, people will have a control on what they do with their asset. Im impatient to see the future of napoleonX ! Et en plus un projet français, que dire de mieux !",pos
I think the project is really promising. The algorithmic crypto asset manageris required in our time and I think will slowly integrating with Blockchain. Congratulations to the Devs for the initiative and effort,pos
"After browsing your website and ANN I have to say, interesting project! I always hear about trading bots here and there, so have to look deeper into your project, to understand it more",pos
"I just saw the roadmap. It has been devoloping for a long time.  Their dedication is admirable, i hope investors would see that and project gets enough funding.",pos
Very nice project! I really like trading bot but they are so hard to configure them. It would be nice some expert would do it for me  Digging more into this platform. Keep up the good work team.,pos
"Great stuff. When this projects holds, what they are describing in their white paper than NaPoleonX will speed up the tokenizing of existing asset markets. As current crypto currency market is still only a small fraction of the money which currently invested in traditional assets. Promising project - both thumbs up!",pos
"Wow, this sounds interesting. Both crypto and bot trading are the future of investing in my opinion. Will definitely check this project.",pos
"Pretty slick presentation although i must admit i might have to see the video again and read up on the whitepaper to wrap my head around the details. I'm really interested in these type of projects because i think they have great potential. Your team seems to have some serious experience, so i'll find the time to read the whitepaper. Hope you guys are also active in the bitcointalk thread in case of questions ",pos
Had a look at the team and it seems they have a solid background with experience from finance. I will for sure have an in depth look at this one.,pos
"The team is very friendly and always answers any questions, this project has great potential. Continue your work.",pos
"More and more new projects are starting to emerge that give a decentralized product! today very well in demand, those companies that offer decentralized exchange! people want, that there were no outsiders - who will manage! I think that this project will have a good popularity!",pos
Great! First time i am seeing actual project with real working product.,pos
Achieve great success. i hope your investments grow and your team gets the reward they deserve.,pos
I hope you advance! Good luck fellows,pos
"Like CrowdSale, the team has been working hard and seriously, all developers have maintained a good job.",pos
"  that's right, there is still hope of this project and the project team should immediately provide clarification we have to understand that because they are definitely trying their best to make things happen for the project",pos
"I read the whole information. An interesting project, a new exchange with innovative products. The most important thing tries to do your best in system security. There are enough attacks on the stock exchanges and the client must be sure of the safety of his funds. Work on the functionality. A good interface and a set of trading tools is the key to success.",pos
I am impressed with this ann! You totally got my attention,pos
"  I agree! This project is a new development for digital currency. I will continue to monitor the specific information, phases of the project. Very interesting!",pos
"This specific project will be solid. There is enough improvements from the crew on slack and other sites. I have been having and accumulated for a while today, and will retain doing so.",pos
CAnt wait to start using NVO wallte.I am sick and tired of all these wallets that are the moment on the market.Supply is only 15 Million so price per coin can rise big time when its out,pos
"   Great explanation! I'm glad to see this project is moving forward, I'll go ahead and pick up some more!",pos
WOW. NVO is one of the few tokens that have not failed today. I believe in decentralized exchanges.,pos
This could be a life changing crypto wishing the team success,pos
Thank you for the updates. All of this sounds very promising.,pos
For real! This wallet is sick! Explains why they invested so much time in it!,pos
"The wallet is sick AF Nice work guys, looking really good. Are you planing to add more coins any time soon?",pos
"Great work with this beta version , well done! 💪💪",pos
That is a lot sooner than I was actually expecting. What a nice surprise!!,pos
Great job NVO team!!! Keep it coming!,pos
Looks like the devs proved all the FUD wrong. They delivered and it looks awesome. Good job to the dev team! fast forward to Q1 2018,pos
"Great wallet NVO team. very pleased with the results, never doubted you guys from the start  -TSWR",pos
"NVO have delivered the wallet before the original deadline as promised, it looks good. Unfortunately haven't been able to use it yet as I'm moving house tomorrow; classic timing. ",pos
"   Agreed, the wallet looks real good, with Waves and Bitshares currently valued at over 730M & 440M respectively, this is going to be interesting ",pos
"   a new video was shown in the slack channell, it was a working wallet and sent transaction, confirmed by blockchain.  they are fixing last hour bugs and gui glitches.   I think a lot of info about the dex will be announced with the wallet release, be ready for the moon.",pos
As far as I know they will resume working with those folks after the wallet is released. I don't believe you have been forgotten. I just think they are putting all their resources into getting an awesome wallet out ASAP.,pos
97%+ of folks have received their tokens.  I cannot wait for the release of the wallet. Seeing it about 3 weeks ago on a skype call with Yanni was awesome and knowing we are so close... gahh. So much excitement.,pos
Bravo! Great job putting this together.,pos
"NVO is alive, great time for holders to stack up at this price. naysayers and weak hands will get F&'%$ as always. ",pos
"CrowdSale ended. Congratulation with NVO, I wanna joining your signature campaign, so I have reserved your threat until my status be eligible.",pos
Do you even try? It's obvious that this project is still going strong.,pos
I'm getting very excited for tomorrow. Trying to buy some more NVST today.,pos
This project is well funded and cryptofreaks are screaming for decentralized exchange right now.Lets have it.Bring it on already.,pos
Bought some more NVST. Can't wait for this wallet to launch!,pos
"    Great News, it is reassuring that NVO is going smooth",pos
"Nice white paper, only useful information with out water. I wish good luck to the project!",pos
Look & feel of new website looks nice.,pos
"congratulation for Nvo succes on your Crowdsale , i think this is potensial for grow i hope all  people see overall for this project and i hope in future Nvo have value witth high price. and have more community.",pos
Thats even better.We look forward to seeing this up and running.  Thanks   ~plusbus,pos
The wallet looks great. Can't wait to use it myself. But I'm still accumelating NVST so prices can stay at these levels a couple of weeks longer.,pos
Finally received my token  Good luck to everybody!,pos
"Im glad the project is moving forward and sounds like theres a plan in place, Im just still holding my tokens(XCP is terrible with their fees). Is there a marketing team in place to get the word out about the project because you competing with WAVES and BTS on this playing friend and they are pretty advanced with their development. I'm personally all for as many DEX as possible but it would be nice if it was used as much as those two. ",pos
I invested in NVO largely to support the building out of the SafeNetwork. I have lost confidence in the NVO team. The communication from the NVO team I've seen on the Safe Forum (see link below) was unprofessional at best and disturbing at worst. https://safenetforum.org/t/nvo-decentralized-exchange-crowdsale/13608/969   If refunds are available I would like to opt out of the NVO project.,pos
Great !! Keep up the good work!!!  any ETA for website ecc?,pos
"   Love it, it will be a hit. One question though, how diverse will coin support be? Will I be able to keep zencash and lbry and other lesser knowns on there?",pos
"   Hello, this is actually an alpha candidate, there is no exchange function into it, it is the basic wallet.  I am pleased that everyone looks satisfied, it is really awesome.",pos
"         Wallet definitely looks good please to hear the progress of the token on that side of things, sucks we're still not on a major exchange but thats okay once the wallet is finished who cares it'll probably give Waves and BTS a run for there money. When is Beta release or is there a Beta release scheduled?",pos
"WOW  Blown away, really good looking wallet, any ETA yet when can it be live? Keep the good work guys!",pos
yes but this is the tip of the iceberg! they are building the backend  with API that the other exchanges and payment systems (eg. coinpayments tenx) can access to be decentralized!  also they have the coinpayments endorsment!,pos
"if this really will works then it will be huge. a multi-coin-hd wallet and a marketplace inside one app. you will be able to delete a lot of wallets and a lot of blockchains stored on your computer. wallet that you only have because you don't want to store the coins an polo, bittrex or other exchanges.",pos
"    As per slack, those aren't mockups, but the wallet is in early developement stage, not even an alpha.  i am very happy that with the big work dev are doing to ensure almost everyone (that have made errors) in the crowdsale have their tokens they found time to progress with the wallet.  Way to go NVO !!!",pos
"The GUI is insanely beautiful, but are the pictures just mockups? If not, then there are already very clear bugs and errors in the wallet..",pos
thank you team. now i received all my tokens. i hope that everybody else got their tokens too.,pos
Glad to see the project is alive and well! I'll admit I got a little nervous when the thread was first started and I was reading about token distribution problems. But I'm glad I chalked it up to investors just not reading the whitepaper or following the instructions correctly. Project is in high demand and should take off once other exchanges are added. Try liqui and tidex they are small and up-an-comers that are probably looking to diversify their offerings besides ERC20 and Waves tokens.,pos
Tokens arrived after comunications with team on slack. Thank you team.,pos
My NVST tokens have safely landed in my counterparty wallet from both of my BTC and XRP contributions.  No actions were needed to see the NVST added as an additional currency  Thank you NVO team!,pos
Received my NVO tokens. Thanks devs. Wish the team a happy start. Can't wait for the NVO wallet to be released to access the tokens.,pos
My NVST tokens have safely landed in my counterparty wallet from both of my BTC and ETH contributions.  Thank you NVO team!,pos
Great job @NVO!  Tokens received.,pos
"The progress of this project is still very fast, there is no trading platform news, hand chips, eager to participate in the transaction",pos
Thanks for the team to be part of this NVO.io team. This is first time I learnt more about the crowd sale little. Moderators like Lauda and other given frequent support about our queries. I will be touch with you guys further as well.,pos
Congratulations to the whole team behind this project. A huge thumbs up to you guys!,pos
Congratulations on the successful crowdsale! Use the funds well and I wish your team good luck on your quest to build something revolutionary for the world of cryptocurrencies.  What are the latest updates with Maidsafe's development? Is your team in close contact with them?,pos
"I am happy to participate in the success of NVO ico sales in my own little way, NVO shall be listed as one of the most successful ico sales and this gives me joy.  I wish the NVO team more success in the future.",pos
"I spent a bit of coins to participate in your all-round, small investment, hoping to fly to the moon",pos
"This we can say now,  was very successful ICO, i hope and exchange will be popular as well. I'm not an investor but when considering where to invest i first look if there is any actual need, in this case i can say yes! We cannot rely no more on centralized exchanges at lest we can reduse their full dominion over our funds. Good luck!",pos
"  In my view this has already been a success with more investment coming into NVO tokens. It's a step away from the other wallet service to attract more users. Than us, already the team might have thought of such plans, because they're much involved into the project than Us.",pos
"Interesting concept, put 0.01BTC your way",pos
11 Days to go before ICO ends. Hoping for the success of this crowdsale and  Can't wait to see the TOKENS listed in EXCHANGE. Once this is live i will make this as my crypto-wallet while doing trades.,pos
"I am investing about half a Bitcoin. This looks very promising, I hope you pull it off.",pos
"This is great ICO, NVO is coming sooner...  Grab it NOW! https://nvo.io  Regards  okane Satoshi",pos
"Great project, almost the same concept like shapeshift it seems  Anyhow, got blog bounty?",pos
Another worth watching project this will gonna be a huge project upon reading some important details really interesting,pos
"   The ICO is doing great with some funds collected, actually i can not quantify it in USD or Btc value due to diversities of different funds ranging from Crpto to fiats.  Visit https://nvo.io to know the current status of this ICO and how to participate.",pos
"Hope ICO is going good. There is great buzz around forum at the moment. Also, I would like to ask is there any development for Mobile wallet?",pos
"NVO , is very good project , im want to apply a sign camp we hope nvo make all partipant get reward and to be happy",pos
Well i wanna also to compliment the great project team and just waiting for the token release. Has anyone of you already DL'd the wallet?,pos
This seems to be promising as well the features added to the exchange service is quite impressive that you cannot find it in any other exchange platforms. Though everything is under a third party they give way by which the entire asset will be in our hands as nothing gets wrong easily even during the time of exchanging.,pos
i too plans to invest on this. i find the project promising. as what you have said they are not the same with other projects who wants solely for compensation. not all projects are working the same way.. i know this will be a success.,pos
"Great project i will try to find some money and invest.Wll be great to join your signature campaigne but my space is occupy now.Wish you the best,we need so much that kind of service",pos
Yes. Its nice to see some wonderful people backing up this project and nemgun doing a marvelous job by answering all the queries here. Will keep an eye on this and will be looking forward to its success. I would suggest members supporting it can tweet about it and let others know about it.,pos
"nice project, hope keep growing, i´m in",pos
This is the first crowdsale or ICO i've taken part in and I couldn't be more excited about it. I did have to create a counterwallet and transfer my funds that way but overall everything was smooth and easy. I was very impressed with the product/service and presentation. Good luck,pos
looks like good project. let see next.,pos
"this project stands and falls with good tech, (that you seem to have) buy also solid UI please dont make the same mistake like poswallet.com and underrate the importance of a good clean ui design, also a decent amount of the investment has to go into this",pos
Quite friendly founders. All good signs of things to come I'm sure.,pos
"NVO + WINGS Would be a great team, keep it in mind ",pos
"Seems a good project,hoping I can join in the ICO soon.",pos
Looks very promising project to me. Im llooking forward to this project. Hope the project succeed. Where can i get an invite on NVO slack channel? I would like to get some updates about the project. Whats the first target exchange NVO to hit. I know it will take long before it hits an exchange. I hope NVO hit Bittrex as a first step.,pos
This is a very intereseting concept,pos
"I congratulate your new secure exchange service! It is still 2 days and 16 hours until your fully launch of NVO.IO, I would be awaiting for the benefits to come in service! Wish you a success on your project.",pos
"the idea is brilliant and in the longrun i even think that there is much more demand for exchanges as crypto is growing  in the short term there will be the issue with volume, there are trading sites that just fight with low volume and i dont really have seen an ""easy"" way to get volume fast",pos
"I'm looking forward for this exchange. It will be great if it works as descriptions are very attractive, the current exchange has not done that! I like this!",pos
"I'm looking forward for this exchange. It will be great if it works as promised, so I can quit Poloniex.",pos
I hope NVO is a great success and I am happy to participate in signature and avatar campaign programs and always success NVO,pos
"nice looking concept, in the future decentralized exchange will replace a centralized exchange good luck dev ",pos
finally another project with a name behind....to many projects behind a newbie account. someone that has a name in bitcointalk put it on the line for a project..i'll watch this one.good luck team,pos
"Interesting project, I believe this is an elegant solution and it this kind of projects are the future of the online exchanges! Keep it up!",pos
"ultimate badass ico, im so in!  any social media bounty campaigns? want 2 spread the word",pos
So we will be having a token which will pay us to hold it on weekly basis... Cool!!! I am so excited about this project. Is there any official date for the start of the sale of this project? Or maybe an estimated date??,pos
"I will watching this one, since lauda confirmed he's the one of the escrow, so this should be a great project. Good luck dev, can't wait for the ICO started ",pos
"the exchange idea is interesting, following.",pos
Seems that this project just added credibility on their side as Lauda already made an unofficial announcement of being one of the escrows of NVO. And sad news for all the airdrop hunters. Sometimes they are just asking freebies even not knowing what the OP is all about.  My impression for this one is that they are sincere & legit.,pos
"Interesting project in this difficult time. In fact, I find this pretty stupid to put our coins into centralized exchange when they are actually meant to be fully decentralized. Followin the project and waiting to see more ! ",pos
"another interesting project which we can try to test investing some of our btc, i think dev have a lots to offer i will watch this thread and wait for more information regarding to the coin launch and how to have some free airdrops good luck and keep the community updated aside from your slack channel.",pos
This sounds great to have decentralized exchange built from scratch so that I will follow this project. Waiting for details about ICO so who will be on escrow side?,pos
If you really get it up and running it will be a milestone in crypto development. Very ambitious project! Good luck! Looking forward to the details.,pos
SONM is on fire @ Binance. Does anyobody know what happened?,neu
Not a scam from what I've read so far. Most likely financial mismanagement and the usual crypto suit cock-up. Getting harder to actually know what horse to back these days considering the fact that most of these startups don't seem to care about treasury management and hiring competent account managers until it all goes belly up,neg
that's great work very appreciate that. what you gonna do next on this site? i think there should be some kind of chat room there where people can share some good thoughts about the sonm project and new ideas but do somthing for avoid flooding. again nice work keep it up,pos
I like the hard work and honest efforts of the dev team they are doing their best to make this project useful in the real world. This is wonderful update surely it will boost the confidence of the community and more people will join this project as new investors and it will help to grow the community.,pos
Dev team is still very active and making wonderful progress to achieve their goals. This is one of best project who have working prototype but it is undervalue that is just matter of time sooner it will get nice place.,pos
Sonm is showing good performance after a very long time of silence I hope it will get succeed to find the new place  on good position. It is undervalue coin with a great use case and very active dev team no doubt this is the real gem of the year.,pos
In future SONM will become top choice for big companies it has working product with great solution. I have big faith in this project it will move towards more high place with power of blockchain tech.,pos
"   I don't think this needs to be doubted because it is indeed a good development, especially with the launch of the commercial render project that is good news",pos
"Today is a great day. Today the whole crypto-blockchain industry became better. A commercial render project has been launched, that uses the compute power of Sonm. By bringing up commercial render with Rays we are not only bringing up Sonm - we are bringing up the whole industry!  Check it out!",pos
Good job.Moving forward.525 place now !   Where are all that laughed at  my words since November 2018?,pos
I want to congratulate the team for another successful milestone complete. Place 504 on Coinmarketcap. Well done and now you can only aim higher. Sky is the limit !,pos
"    You can't expect that every ICO will make you a millionaire. The team is making good progress, just be patient",pos
"Good project, I'm wery happy to be a supplayer on it I am glad to answer your's questions friends)",pos
Great week for Rays for two reasons! (1) A checkpoint has been passed - new workflow works. Task estimation and credit card payment - everything is ready. (2) Rays mentioned as the fastest render service in an independent research. Read new report!,pos
"   This is not true. It was noted in the latest roadmap release from the team that they believe in the future of Ethereum development, and they think it is currently the superior platform.  Even if the team changes to the BNB chain or not, I am confident the team will make the right decision.",pos
"  SONM fundamentals are good, they focus on products not at the price of SONM itself, this is like the case of waves, but if the developer lets it, SONM will experience a large decrease in community and volume, and Binance may delete the SNM market, hopefully it doesn't happen!",pos
"  What do you mean man? See new roadmap and two reports (1,2). As for the price, the team just doesn't want to influence it or make shilling. And no one wants to huge pump this token. No marketmaking. No viral marketing. No huge partnerships. But there is a real product, and primacy in readiness for the real business of the product among all similar projects. But after all, nobody cares about this, right? Only 2themoon and x100 matters to everyone...",pos
"I am really excited about the new roadmap that was published by the SONM team. If the team can deliver on this, and get some more use of the SONM token, we should see some positive price action soon.  I've been holding SONM for 2 years now, and it is still the top on my list of 'sleeping stars'.",pos
"  well you bhought very cheap, some people bought in last year bull run and still holding. in next bull run crypto will break its last all time high record i hope. and after that altcoins will boom specially that projects who develop good and team still working on it like SONM. good hopes for sonm ",pos
"Great news for our community, holders and everyone interested in our project! Sonm is now available at Blockfolio Signal. Now it is easier for everyone to track the major updates from the team: https://blockfolio.com/coin/SNM",pos
"  What is certain is all of our hopes that the SNM price can increase as far as possible, but somehow I think it depends on the development team as well as the most important thing we trust in the team",pos
"  It is true that I myself also think that it is very likely that SONM is still able to grow again, but we also do not know, of course, so it will be better to continue to follow the development",pos
ICO raised money was a long ago situation. i don't think that sonm team still holds the raised money in coins. by my point of view they convert that whole raised money into fiat for the project development. sonm did good and take the project that far. best wishes for the team and i hope they will do more for develop the project and make it success,pos
great shot) good volumes came in,pos
"  Yes, i think is good news for everyone, time to buy sonm and hold few months to get profit. It's time cryptocurrency make great again",pos
Good to see some real world use for SONM. This rendering looks good and will hopefully get others interested in buying and using some sonm. If they can get some companies to use it as well then it would do wonders for marketing,pos
"Today Sonm exceeded, for the first time, a hash rate of 100,000 Mh/s.  Also total spend on the Sonm network is at an all time high; $5800/day (or an equivalent of $2m/year).  Both hash rate and total spend have doubled in the last two weeks. Let’s hope this trend continues!",pos
Sonm have working product and this network have great chance to explode no doubt this is wonderful chance to buy more at cheap price. This time we will see more big rally which will create new generation of millionaire.,pos
"  sonm team is definitely active in promoting their service, but right now as you can see market situation is not good only top crypto currencies are making some progress, sonm is real and active project hopefully in near future sonm service will expand and more companies will use it to gain more computing speed.",pos
"  the promotion is very good, in my opinion, just to convince the investors and the price will rise to the top if like that all will be good and SONM is not a false project, I am sure they are trying to get investors to look at these coins and we just have to wait because will be very sure it will be better in the future",pos
"  in the future SONM will definitely make that happen, because you know yourself now mining with GPU is very difficult, SONM provides information about Nvidia 1080Ti GPUs can provide $ 2 reward per day, this I think is good",pos
"Sonm is better than golem but only when comparing technology. In terms of marketing I would say Golem has the upper hand. Somehow they made it possible for people to believe that Golem is something amazing, but in reality sonm has much more to offer",pos
Yes it's better let's just see what happens later and hope SONM is better than the Golem. I am very confident that the team will certainly work to develop the most important SONM for now. We must be patient first,pos
i agree with you that sonm is different then other similar projects but the development matters and key of this project success. team is expanding sonm coverage again. this is good step but still sonm needs to advertise itself more for big companies. i hope in future sonm will be a successful and fastest in fog computing,pos
That is correct that SONM is different than other projects which at large look like similar but they all have different areas of services and goals. That's why it is not good to mix them up with one another. SONM is also entering in new phase of development and marketing to create awareness about the use cases and services which are being or will be offered to industries. I do strongly believe that ahead lot of interesting things will be happening for SONM.,pos
Agreed with you this is best opportunity to dive in into this project as they are doing best job and establishing this platform really well so that I also hope in future this will get more attention. Sonm is looking more promising than ever.,pos
"The recent partnerships and the price chart on general makes me extremely bullish on SNM. Have been watching it after it got added to Binance, but never pulled the trigger. Now seems like the best time to watch it, especially after the price corrected back after the fat (green) finger that happened with enormous volumes.",pos
This is good news finally it has been added to wallet and this will attract the new investors to buy this with comfort without creating account on any exchange.,pos
[/quote]  This is the really amazing approach how to build a healthy ecosystem and keep moving forward with clear goals. Sonm is most active platform and they know about their destination this plan is looking realistic so that I will make this the best project in this field.,pos
"i think team SONM it's still active and make some progress, team add SONM to Binance. price now very cheap, we just waiting and keep calm to moment team to pump this coin.",pos
Great piece of work the team is bringing more utilities on the platform to make this more convenient and user friendly to provide peace of mind to all users. Sonm deserve to be among top market with this kind of hard work.,pos
This looks like an awesome project. Will be watching this one is there any bounty program available ? thank,pos
"   I remember the whitepaper, was well done and full of promises, you add the marketing and they were able to raise a huge amount of $ (didn't invest myself btw, I just bought some time ago when it was @ 1000 sat)",pos
It's mind blowing dev team is improving the Sonm OS and now it looking more cool than before as well as future plan is also sounds great. Sonm is here to stay and it will lead in Fog computing with efficient platform and it will turn into giant.,pos
sonm is great project with great potential right now its price is much lower then its ICO price and i think price of sonm token is at fully bottom right now currently buying sonm and hodl can worth a lot i mean buying current price and in near future if sonm price touch even its ico price then holders of sonm could make 10 time more profit from it,pos
Without any doubt 2018 was year of achievements dev team achieved so their milestones successfully. If dev will keep continue with same spirit than upcoming year will be more amazing for Sonm. It's good article and there is good summary of year 2018.,pos
Indeed team SONM have some mind blowing plans for next few months which will bring more attention for this platform. Reward program is also looking amazing surely it will make this more hot and this is the good time to buy more.,pos
There are some exciting plans are in pipeline which will draw more better reputation of this project and will make this more advanced platform in fog computing. The team is already working with good approach to catch the every moment to make this more hot.,pos
partnerships is a great choice for a project in current time period as crypto facing bearish move with these partnerships and updates sonm will gain more value soon when the berish period will over and some news already comes that berish move is over. i will hold my crypto and wait until next year Q2 right now is only one thing to do invest in good projects like sonm,pos
Good news Sonm is doing nice job it looking this is good decision to invest in this project. This platform is live than that kind of news will bring more attention to this project and it will make satisfied to all investors.,pos
That sounds great just read the detailed report about this partnership and integration of this protocol on the SONM platform. This is good sign about the future it will attract so many new project to use this platform to decentralized computing resources.,pos
Don't spread FUD dude... SONM is an awesome project with working product... developers are working very hard and they deliver every promise on time. Great opportunity to buy more cheap SNM!,pos
"  i think sonm team is doing great and they work on developments very fast sonm project is huge so it takes time to be fully develop. ARM is great and for being late to implement it not a prob for us just we need to team make sure its fully error free ""Sonm will be among headliners at the most important IT event in Russia & CIS - Highload. The event is dedicated to compute-intensive products and their developers. Sonm Core Team Lead Eugene Safronov will deliver a speech on Decentralized NAT Punching."" source: http://www.highload.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4319 this is good news",pos
This is little fast another successful pre-ico congrats for this nice start. I hope today you will achieve your target as it's going crazy so many people were waiting to take participate in this.,pos
looks really interesting ! what will be the ICO bonus ?? I hope I will have time to invest in preICO I'm waiting some investements to go out on market soon,pos
"Your project seems good, so wonderful after reading your white paper, good luck to the team and hopefully get a better replacement.",pos
"SONM can be next large ICO project for supercomputer? I guess yes, you are definitely the best project. Surpass golem, iex, xel and so forth, you are best!",pos
Amazing !!! I like it !,pos
Great project! What about signature company and other bounties? Can I reserve for Russian translation?,pos
"Perhaps your project is beautiful, but I must warn you that when you click on the white paper button, the antivirus severed the connection, maybe you need to check the site for viruses?",pos
"Very impressive, the idea of this project I feel is very good, I hope the team can work together to provide more exciting ideas, so I will support you.",pos
"I may be interested in seeing the progress of the project and looking this ICO success. Project indeed interesting, let's see how the team in the project can make this ICO run smoothly. What currency will be used to store the funds raised? And where exactly?",pos
"nice project I like the concept, looks promising project interesting to partisipate to this project,  hopefully succesful joined bounty campaign for support this project.  good luck",pos
"I think your project is interesting and promising, I want to ask what happened to the token that did not reach Hardcap, will it be burned? I hope your project will be success.",pos
"I think this project can have few partners from some other projects available here to build a consortium it will sure make huge success for all of participants. Project Tokens can be purchased only for btc and ETH or for fiat, too, is possible?",neu
Interesting idea; do you know any potential partners? We'd be happy to discuss a potential consortium depending on the project/team,pos
I truly believe in #StreamPay coin project that it will definitely a successful project. We should not miss such a nice opportunity to be a part of #StreamPay,pos
still 30 days left and it will be more increases everyday is possible to reached goal 6000 btc. Good luck team wetrust.,pos
Percentage of Cap Raised 22.5% Crowdsale Ends In 30 days  WeTrust it's going very well,pos
"$2M is a grat achevment,This proves that WeTrust has won the trust of crypto community",pos
$2m USD has been raised and still counting the community is showing their trust on this great project. congratulation for this achievement I'm quite sure they will achieve their goal in prior time.,pos
yeah btc is solid and everyone says that it will be accepted as ETF one day anyway and the same idea that ETH is the second. I think long term BTC and ETH is a very good investement. WeTrust made a good choice for their ICO,pos
"   Nice ,this is great. This time dev very fast update signature and ll stuff.Cool Good work and good luck !!",pos
All team/member WeTrust have good skills and they work hard. And also the support of the community to make this project can compete with other projects Great jobs team and supporters?,pos
Already 300 signature participants and 1336 BTC invested. I think we can do better but this ICO is already a success to me,pos
"  you are amazing guyys , support for we trust I'm sure this project will be successful ... I will also support through social media",pos
Very good jobs Devs!,pos
Very good. I think 5000 btc will be reached in ICO.  Interested to participate in crowdsale.,pos
+1300 btc raised. This is awesome,pos
"As bitcoin price going down now,we will see a flood of investment in WeTrust. This will going to be the best ICO this year",pos
This project will be very ruge. Keep in touch boys,pos
"   Just had a look now,nice amount of ETH collected..  all the best to team",pos
i have high hopes for this project.  2 former googlers.  george's spec is impressive. Mckinsey as well.,pos
even I am expecting Wetrust will easily cross 2k btc by this week,pos
Should be successful。,pos
Project development is very good.,pos
WeTrust has a great team. Good luck with the crowdsale!,pos
I think wetrust can be successfull fastest,pos
This would be great fund raising campaign hopefully will achieve the target in next 2 weeks. Glad to be part of this campaign will support this one so good luck to all community for such amazing support.,pos
"   I'm convinced WeTrust will score a good result. The first 24 hours are always very intense with such a bonus, often are the last 24 hours. But maybe that the 6k BTC will be reached earlier.",pos
"21% cap already, and 40 days left. its going good.",pos
"Just 1 days, wetrust can be collected 1200 bitcoin  Thats is amazing...",pos
"Interesting idea, great team, good luck with the sale.   WATCHING! ",pos
Congrats for 1250 BTC! Thats great!,pos
"  i'm really excited, i call this double rise.. raised minimum Thresholds also raised price btc ",pos
This is growing quite nicely.,pos
"   Yes logically, this is a great opportunity for your project. And I hope this will be a great success for all participants.",pos
@s0nix: Thank you! We are very excited about this opportunity,pos
"waiting for the big success  of   wetrust,,,  ICO is  sucessful now",pos
A nice level of money being collected. Now gives 25% bonus. I have a little send.,pos
Congrats the minimum target has been reached It is possible to get 10k btc. Wait and see.,pos
"1239 BTC raised, Almost 1.600.000 usd in 36 hours, Congratulations !!!!  WeTrust Project going very well. Congratulations !!!!",pos
"1239 BTC raised, Almost 1.600.000 usd in 36 hours, Congratulations !!!!",pos
Conggratulation dev goodjobs,pos
Iconomi must have invested a lot of ETH. This is the signal for a promising project. Don't miss this ICO,pos
Looks good! I've invested a tiny bit but will wait and see how BTC goes (and hopefully invest more).,pos
"It is even more impressive to collect 1000 BTC during this crypto craziness with top altcoins like ETH pumping hard and bitcoin at an all time high, I know how hard it was for me personally as an investor. Also, if ETH were quadruples in price from here, the crowdsale will be over.",pos
No doubt it is a good project and getting so much funding in such a short period is great but I am afraid it would be over priced.,pos
"   Congratulations, right on time +30% bonus  More than 1.200 btc over 1.5m usd in 24 hours !!!! This is a success, this project is hugely promising !",pos
"   I am interest with this project, where can i joined wetrust ICO?",pos
"Well, I'm officially invested. Let's do this thing!",pos
Good to see lots of investments already. BTC price is still holding at high. And ETH has seen also an increase.,pos
"Everything about this project is strong right now, ICO,bounties, dev team, advisors (Bo shem)... I'd be suprised if polo doesn't pick it up immediately.",pos
"Just after a day it launched, this project has collected enormous amount of ICO funds. The reception to this ICO is having a strong indication that people like the idea of this blockchain loan business . I will be watching this.",pos
"WeTrust has everything to be one the best crypto project of 2017, that's why i jump in. Also i just submitted an application for signature campaign, kindly check up my application. Thank you very much",pos
Wow this is very nice..Promised project!!!,pos
"I'm in, very interesting project with strong team.",pos
"   This performance is good even with the Bitcoin rally, people still trust WeTrust team with their Bitcoin rather than hold on to their coin.",pos
Almost 1.500.000 usd raised in 18 hours what a success!  1137 BTC,pos
Wow. After Chronobank's huge success WeTrust following it with a bang. Even with Bitcoin continously on the rise still people believe that someone is worth investing.,pos
"1 day already raised more 1000btc,,we will see this project forward with a promising future ",pos
Good project with a strong team. I'm in,pos
Pretty wild they got a first day raise like this. Also the team looks really legit. I'm all in on this one. Looks like a platform with some legit returns....,pos
"It is great to see WeTrust raising 1,118 btc in just 16 hours when there are other ICOs competing for funds. This shows the support of the community to the project. I hope WeTrust team raise as much as funds possible and achieve their end goals!",pos
"Really optimistic on the funding progress, you guys do a good pre-ico marketing, we can get benefits and profits from your platform, IMO it is the main reason that you got so much fund in a few hours.",pos
"wow i think we trust have a good CRODSALE , 1K btc is a big value   congrats dev! good luck!",pos
Both we trust and edgeless exceeds the minimum threshold right after 24hrs ICO starts. This is a good sign that there are still many investors trusting on ICO project . I'm counting on we trust  project since they have some whale investors and  they were being promoted by ICONOMI that well known for being a successful project. I will be investing some of my coin on this project.,pos
"The Minimum threshold has been exceeded, congratulation and for first week the Bonuses is 25% just decrease 5% from first day bonuses, I bet the fund will still increased day by day.",pos
amazing... good project and good luck sir,pos
"Congratulations on crossing the minimum threshold mark,this project will finally be live now !!!",pos
"I think Daniel of ICONOMI evaluation of this project is having impact on the performance of this ICO. Over 1000BTC is a good achievement for this project, only few projects can claim to have achieved this on the first day",pos
"only a few days and  raise about 1000+ btc , obviously the project will be success , congratulation",pos
"I can't believe the level of support this project is having, over 1000BTC in 12hours and still counting. I think we won't see another Decent like ICO here where 90% of the fund was received on day one.",pos
Without a doubt! TRST most likely one of the most promising ICO this 2017.,pos
This project will be success,pos
This project will be success Good news ico already raised 962 btc in a few hours.,pos
"Well, it is now obvious that this project's minimum requirements will be meet with ease! Glad I stumbled upon it and seems like the correct decision  to support it, in any way possible.",pos
HOLY WAT SERIOUSLY  Almost 1k Btc within 24 hour!  I think this would be the one who will be the pioneer of insurance/loan platform in the crypto!  Good luck!,pos
"   Looks like this one is going to be good, big and fair. I likey!",pos
"so far so good ICO for launch 1hours 628 BTC collected ,congrats Wetrust.io nice job for team ",pos
Congrats WeTrust. You can look at my history and you will see I have been involved in ICO's dating back to AMP & FCT ( still hodling ;P ) This is by far the smoothest launch I have seen to date. Can't wait to see what the future holds in store.   **Edit** Felt I needed to add that them delaying the crowdsale due to AWS outage was awesome.,pos
Great ICO started Just few hour can be 500+ btc investation,pos
"Congratulations to the WeTrust Team ! Best Ico ever !  Nice and working fine  23.611 ETH, 143 Btc...",pos
so excited to see the starting of  ico,pos
"It is great project, will it accept bitcoin or eth?",pos
"starting to like the concept , there is a demo somewhere to test it or after ico ?",pos
Rarely have I seen such a strong team leading a new crypto project as the WeTrust Team. I have high hopes for a good success as the concept is well thought out. Wishing each team member all the best and good luck!,pos
"Good luck with WeTrust project, I hope all be perfect!!",pos
"got it ,,,wetrust is built on ETH chain,,,only thing I know  is that seem this coin has a  good  dev team ,,,hope it will be successful..",pos
Glad to see this people who are leader in cryptocurrency converging/helping the wetrusts project. They are leader in their own field and a trusted name in crypto world. This will create more trust and confident and hope more investor will join in for this beautiful project.,pos
Dream is real guys! we gotta hit the threshold,pos
Interesting concept and incentive. I'll keep my eyes close to it .,pos
Thanks for that. This makes it safer and more trustworthy. -> We trust in WeTrust,pos
30% bonus in the first day it is a great bonus to participate in ico.,pos
"weTrust team very active on this thread and answer all questions, keep up the good work team",pos
"  Yeah, i'm wondering why ETH is still so cheap. This one and dozens of others projects are brilliant!",pos
seems another great project is starting on ETH,pos
I said he is such a person for me (especially for making DAO fork). But I said it's good news for WeTrust because he is a huge brand in crypto and he must use his name only for trusted projects.,pos
"Oh, Vitalik Buterin one of your new advisors. The popularity of WeTrust goes up every day. That can be a really great ICO in 2017!",pos
"   vitalik is strange/controversial?  he's a genius, unlike most of the clowns in the crypto space.  Vitalik is better than the rest of the advisors there combined.  Very good news.",pos
"Vitalik really? He is a strange/controversial person for me, but there are big money behind him so I believe he wouldn't put his face behind a scam/trustless project. That's another good news for WeTrust.",pos
Hey this is amazing.  I have the feeling WeTrust can still handle great things. Right now the interest is huge.,pos
"   If true ICONOMI come to invest in the project WeTrust,It is very good News as previously ICONOMI ever mensuport and invest in projects GOLEM,,thanks for the reply and his information led me to believe WeTrust will be successful in doing ICO,",pos
Hello WeTrust! This project looks perfect for me and i hope that you will collect the necessary funds. Joined twitter campaign. Hope i will participate in WeTrust ICO too.,pos
"   Don't underestimate this project, it consists of strong devs, therefore 1000 BTC is doable and achievable, I have faith on WETRUST.",pos
I think Wetrust ICO can be successful,pos
"    Good work guys. Mainnet is ready, I think the ICO we hit the target quick. The team seem to be committed to the platform and this is going to pay off in future, 6000BTC is not a big ask at all",pos
This project is really advancing fast. Hopefully this accelerated development will continue all throughout. And transform their promises to realizations.,pos
"Joined to signature campaign, months waiting for an interesting project, ready to invest on first days to get the bonus.  Im glad you set a limit of 6000 btc, other projects who raised more money are not doing good, and investors lose money and hope. (Waves, Lisk)  And i like you are a team, not a single person project. Congrats and good luck, watching close this project.",pos
really hope this is a good coin,pos
great project so interest to follow and keep my eyes on this thread,pos
"    This is a very intelligent move by WeTrust team, not every team release their mainnet before the ICO and this will instill confidence in the project. I think team can hit the minimum target on day 1",pos
"    Wow,great update,this will give a good confidence in the mind of investors to invest in this project",pos
"    Great WeTrust team, good to relaese your mainnet before the ICO, this proof the team is ready and set for the crowdfunding. When is the Escrow names going to be released All the best",pos
I think thats is verry goodnews goodjobs dev,pos
"With the great team,  i think wetrust ICO can be successfull goodluck dev",pos
Nice update team! Hopefully the ICO min is reached and surpassed,pos

Wow that really an awesome news  Congrats team,pos
Wings have the WINGS this project have great potential to fly to the moon. Some big names are getting involved deeply into this project so that I'm quite sure this will be next big thing for sure.,pos
"      Good job, Wings team!",pos
WINGS got the wonderful support to fly in upcoming days investment will be huge this project is looking most promising and have a great future ahead. Still time to invest into project so many great news about to come out.,pos
"  Would I suggest project and not invest myself? Off-course I have invested, as many of others from this topic. And don't ask how much.",pos
More and more good news coming! No doubt this is a very good opportunity for us to see the real use of Wings!,pos
Good work wings team!,pos
I think it's wiser for now to set aside some for investment into WINGS. This is once in a lifetime opportunity to have a low priced share before it could cost a fortune.,pos
"      Sounds interesting, looking forward to seeing their proposal",pos
"Now that WINGS team are recruiting prominent personalities in crypto , it must a strategy for long term and influential move to lure potential donators on WINGS ICO.",pos
"Investor Chandler Guo join board of Advisors, this is good news, I think. He is well known in ETH,ETC community.",pos
This ICO still has long period and anyone can still donate . Dont be left behind with this once in a lifetime opportunity in crypto world.,pos
this project has huge potential and team will succeed even with 2k btc,pos
That's great and good to hear.. I'm excited about the project can't wait to see what's in store.. is there any company's that you can name that will be apart of wings when it launches?,pos
Everybody is so positive about this project and participants are eager to know how many DAO at launch will be forecasted . Some are anticipating the Egg redemption site. Just full of excitement with WINGS.,pos
Wings looks very interesting I have invested in ICO and looks promising.. just hope that wings learned from the original DAO what not to do.. I see by reading this thread that wings already have projects ready which is very promising,pos
Let them dump for weak hands have no place in a great platform like WINGS. To which big whales will take advantage of the situation.,pos
"With btc rising, the value of WINGS token is proportionately increases. Some good signs indeed.",pos
So better contribute now . Wings will be successful and it is now having its ICO so dont fomo.,pos
"   Yeah and that's exactly why projects need a strong community backing in which, WINGS, do.",pos
As far as I know wings platform has the most innovative approach to enhance blockchain technology and can make people understand how important a consensus would be that is to be a part of the system.,pos
Wings is a good project with strong team .,pos
I definitely would salute your right decision to participate in WINGS ICO. Good things are coming and more.,pos
"A friend of mine told me about wings project. It spoked about DAO technology and other stuff, he's very entusiast about the team. So i'm going to join the crowfund in few hours. It is not only for speculation this time",pos
"Investors are slow after that first day opening. I think I read already that developers will continue the project with the collected fund. Oh well, if the fund won't increase that much after ICO i'll be happy with an undervalued Wings as it will surely explode once it enters the exchanges like some undervalued coins did.  ",pos
"  I hope this is a real, May you can put polo on the priority of wings team. I have thought if that was being the piercing sword for attracting a new demand. And I believe which choose the different way from the other camp. Will giving a good result for wings. I'm in and was supporting for this one.",pos
"  I think it's fair enough, I am also waiting to claim wings tokens, I believe it would be a great wings soon",pos
"   Don't worry your socks off. The final week will bring in massive money. Right now, the big investors are holding off so they can come in at the end.  This is because of the %bonus. Big buyers don't care about the bonus because it naturally helps out the little people buying in. If less people buy in during the bonus period, it only means his share will be much bigger when he does invest, and then the FOMO will kick in. So the people who are hesitant to buy in during the bonus will ultimately buy in without a bonus because the ICO is deemed a success.  Same thing happened with waves.",pos
The shock of Slock.it makes all of the dao projects hard.   Cheer up. wing !  User friendly UI and system will be sucess !   From wan,pos
Indeed a wise decision. Pretty soon you'll realize you made the right choice. Support wings all the way.,pos
Invested some amount Wishing all the best to this project!,pos
"I think these guys are really know what to do and will have a sucess. Good idea, nice conversation with community, fine marketing campain and, as wings said, work under exchange listining. Good luck.",pos
Go wings I believe that your hardwork will eventually have fruitful  outcome.,pos
your hardwork will surely ripe good fruits...still more 20+ days to go..so can expect a huge investment,pos
"     WOW, it gonna very huge project, 5 million may be hit.",pos
i anticipate WINGS to get past 2k btc in a week....  also hope iconomi invests in wings,pos
"WINGS is very promising project and I'm pretty sure about the brighter future, invested some amount there and hopefully it will grow so fast and it backed by community, there is huge community support behind this one so when it will reach to close date than we will see big investment there, so good luck to all.",pos
Wings really has been getting support as a testament to the first 2 days $1m donations it has received. Go Wings.,pos
"  True. This project is very transparent (Devs, Escrow, the project itself)",pos
Wings will be success,pos
Good start guys. All the best!,pos
WINGS ICO is getting a warm reception from participants. 1000 btc on 1st day.,pos
"   Yeah, very long term project, from we see their signatute until now, many months, more than half a year. They are legit team and project, I assume they wikl succeed eventually",pos
...and I just can't wait to participate through their ICO. It is been long delayed but highly anticipated . It is good that this will finally push through. I have to find enough funds to donate . Go Wings.,pos
Five days more to and ICO will start . I got to find a way how to accumulate more BTC or ETH to participate in the donation process . I got to get more Wings token as possible. This is the most exciting ICO I will ever encounter.,pos
I'm also as ready as you are. Boy this is so much fun and exciting. Antshares has already collaborate with wings platform.,pos
yes i am ready with my bitcoins. i think this ico will be one of the biggest ico ever.,pos
very well excited in WINGS ico . Imagine this is 5 months in a waiting. But definitely a worth to be one.,pos
"   Definitely, so much excitement is brew over the WINGS dev team. Anticipating the ICO has never been so much fun.",pos
So some features will be added in wings.ai once ICO starts this coming November 18? I'm very excited for this project.,pos
"very nice, keep growing day by day",pos
"Wings DAO is probably the much anticipated project these coming days and I am confident it will easily break 10,000 BTC. As a future stakeholder of this project I am concerned of its value when it hits the open market. I saw ZEC dropped from the sky at very fast rate. How can Wings DAO escape the same fate? I think possible early dumpers on Wings will be the bounty hunters. Maybe just reward bounty hunters (I also have my own bounty ) at a later date or offer with another alts.    ",pos
Oh date is moved to November 18 now. I don't mind it though. Seems like everything is going to work at near 100% come ICO date.,pos
"        retweet done, i believe we will reach 50k ",pos
I believe Wings will be a huge project and I am waiting for ICO.,pos
followed and tweeted.,pos
Nothing to worry . Wings will not end up the same fate with theDAO because of its unique and sophisticated consensus method for smart contract executions.,pos
It's great that Wings is getting the attention it deserves. The upcoming ICO is so highly anticipated.,pos
this is a wonderful project and I am looking forward  to be support it in the backing campaign.,pos
Great promoting plan! I'm in.,pos
Great plan dev. Soon we will witness the first DAO that will be forecasted and voted upon by supporters of WINGS.,pos
"     Nice, that will be a great tool for DAOs to use. I've joined with a tweet.",pos
"looking forward to when start ICO, to buy some WINGS, its be a better DAO",pos
Things are really quite interesting in WINGS DAO as the ICO date approaches. Many people are pretty much anticipating this .,pos
The excitement is really really high here in the sky. How much you guys think Wings can reach? Maybe they can surpass ICONOMI's ICO? I hope so.,pos
"   It's a quite optimistic scenario which we will be very happy to see happening, and it's our last goal.",pos
I got my wings jet pack ready. Wings platform will surely be embraced by enthusiast world wide,pos
Now guys it is time to rock. Wings is expected to be a great product. I got to collect some for money to participate. It's a once in a lifetime chance.,pos
we will see more progress in this coming weeks i know dev are really working hard to make this project to succeed.,pos
"   I'm very impatient with this project will all eyes of the world will be heading here,wish the best WINGS dao team ",pos
"WINGS devs are really into marketing now , expect the huge acceptance from all corners of the world.",pos
I see devs are starting to roam around the world to make Wings as closer to people who are very much interested in digital assets.,pos
"    Very interesting project, will be waiting to see how the ICO terms are worked out.",pos
"What is the total supply of wings? Thanks, ico looks very near, want to join.",pos
"This project looks very interetsing. I want to contribute to this, i can manage some translations perhaps...  When is the project is going to be launched?",pos

The Wings team activity is commendable,pos
"Wow quite a job the team has made so far, when is the ICO launch date? I hope i wont miss the early bonus",pos
Wow! Finally time for this to fly high. I'm still thinking how much I can afford on this during ICO. Hopefully I have enough fund because I am planning to have some on the first day as possible. Cheers!,pos
This is the most highly-anticipated ICO project. I really can't get enough sleep thinking about wings.,pos
"This is probably the most valuable of a new coin in the fourth quarter of 2016, I will invest in it.",pos

we are ready for this!,pos
I am really excited about this. It is time to spread the news and share the information about wings.,pos
"  Finally Wings will fly Waiting for ICO details, I hope Early Birds bonuses will be high, but there will be some (few days) time to get full bonuses",pos
"good news, get ready for WINGS ico guys ",pos
"Great news, got some coins ready and looking forward to the start!",pos
I am currently following promising coins and this is probably one of the best. So I guess the ICO is expected to happen before 2016 ends?,pos
Finally the whitepaper has been released. Great structure and unique way of creating forecasting and managing DAOs.,pos
eagerly waiting for this,pos

I like the team is open in regards of deleays. Take your time to complete the thing. Looking forward too see the eggs turning into small chicken,pos

"Optimistic about this, looking forward to the future development",pos
"Very interesting project, I have a question, why do you choose chatbot interface, is chatbot necessary for this kind of application? Thanks",pos

"     whether you guys pull this off or its someone else, the concept of simplification is excellent - removing the need for coding expertise to create/manage a DAO.  also great is the integration between multiple networks. it may be ALOT of work to pull off successfully, but creating this type of versatility - while simplifying the DAO creation/management processes for the less-technically-inclined is a great foundational philosophy/aim to begin with...",pos

Looks impressive. Following.,pos
"I also would like to reserve my spot too for future update and news, website is looking unique and cool and i am hopeful this project will rock soon.",pos
Hey/ Nice project. What protocol you use for tokens?,pos
"Great project, indeed it is time to insert the machine learning technology into crypto assets trades. In practical terms, does this means that you will not longer need trader ?   ",pos
Nice project and platforms,pos
"  1 XYD = 0.24 USD. Pretty good, i think",pos
What for do we need tokens? The idea of platform seems promising.,pos
"I like this project. I don't know about team, but their website, whitepaper and GitHub looks good and promising.",pos
"What is the end date of sale? And yeah, the project is nice.",pos
"  I know, right? Like it's absurd. Maybe they have some reasons. Their project seems good and whitepaper.",pos
Doesn't look like scum to me. I have already invested.,pos
Love your concept boys. Is there airdrop campaign?,pos
"hello, i think this is a feasible project, i like this platform, the project has the participation of vietnamese people. wish the project succeed",pos
That's actually smart.,pos
I like your team. Can you explain what is arbitrage trading?,pos
"hm, great idea. When do they plan to start sales?",pos
You have great potential. Where will be the XYD tokens stored?,pos
"  Huh. I see, simple and smart decision.",pos
Thats nice. And there also will be a choice to keep them on your platform for future investments?,pos
"   Yes, this is all if properly implemented and applied, it really opens up great and new opportunities, let's hope that all this will be realized in the end. With the help of decentralized technologies and AI, it enables the professionals to build and manage their professional global profiles, making pre-screening and private networking much easier. TrustLogics enables its users to build their reputation by verifying their education and other skills assessed by certified validators within the network with the power of Smart Contracts.",pos
"  You know, there will be nothing to lose in this project. It is already a success project, so whether they are supported or not, they are already running. Their application is already available int application store. They just need the fund to fully operate.",pos
"  If not as soon as possible then for the next generations.   We have nothing to be against this project. If we canâ€™t benefit from it now, surely the next generations will. Our children and childrens children will do. Supporting Trustlogics will also mean preparing for the future of our next generations.",pos
  Anyway there will be no need to worry about profiles being stolen because Trustlogics make stores it safely in their database and besides no chance for fake profiles since every profiles will be verified by partnered validators so it will just be a waste of time to steal and fake resumes.,pos
  What is good with Trustlogics is being scammed will never ever enter your mind since all the proofs of legitimacy has already been presented here. The project is already bearing fruits and they are just waiting them to ripen so they can harvest from its fruits.,pos
"Still skeptical about uploading your private info online? With TrustLogics, it will be secure. We understand the need to protect data of all users ensure that any third-party access is reliant on user-defined permissions. #TrustLogics #private #info trustlogics.io  Well, not all website are secure, if i upload my profile in an unsecured platform other people will not suffer but only me. My identity could be stolen and someone may reproduce another account similar to mine and just steal my details.",pos
"Experienced advisory board. Product is good, vision is good. There is a huge market and competition also. But with experienced team I feel they will deliver the promise.",pos
Good and well formed experienced team. Already has MVP and two partnerships.,pos
  You are right sonjay22. Itâ€™s been long that cryptocurrency has not kick that high already and most holders are not havng a good taste of their holdings. So i hope too that trustlogics will be able to cope up with their expenses for the project and everything with the current status of digital currencies right now.,pos
"   Yea. And even if the ICO will be over, I will still keep following this platform to see how much and to what extent they could do to benefit people in the area of recruitment. I am lookingg forward to this platform as a truly beneficial and and truly a breakthrough to recruitment industry.",pos
    i agree with you my friend you cant put 100% trust on ICOS this days you have to consider many things such a the roadmap and the identity of the team behind the project.,pos
"  Wow! This is wonderful. No one can stop now the on going progress of this project. We can see the upstoppable progress that Trustlogics is making now. In this news, I can see that the partnered validators will once again take a big role in this partnership of Trustlogics with Authbridge.",pos
   Lucky are those validators huh! Trustlogics will be giving them a job. What a blessig would they be to individual service providers who are oftentimes being overlooked if they dont have a strong back up. Nice concept Trustlogics has.,pos
"  With the award they just got lately, for sure they are not playing here. Nobody can even accuse them they are scam and they partnership they have with curacao also is another accomplishment so what more to doubt?",pos
"    I completely agree with you, we need more such projects useful to the society and I hope that they will become more and more with time. And this project I'm sure its place will take, the main thing is that the team worked.",pos
"    Great! Good to know having this kind of opportunity in our community in order to help people who are willing to work legally in which they really wanted too. Well i think this would be the most popular system in the world, because of having very well-secured in their system and the concept of their project is very interesting. I hope this project will be successful, cause as we all know we it gives us benefits and also it will bring us to a brighter future.",pos
"     Yes, projects that are aimed at solving global problems and assistance, this is certainly very attractive and promising. I would also like very much that this team managed to implement such a good project, but so far from the general statistics of all projects, in the end very few people succeed. But I hope that everything will turn out here and I will be happy to support it.",pos
"   Are you saying that Truslogics can't do something about the bad records of the applicants on this case huh? Though, in some other point of  view you had a point in it, I guess that this project can do something about it.",pos
"TrustLogics offering a three-way attestation using their TLT Tokens, first and foremost, spells comfort.  Imagine your professional data being attested and certified without leaving the comfort of your home. No need for the unpleasant travels, long ques and waiting time, transferring from government agencies to private notaries, and so on.  All these in lieu of just a few clicks, i'm sure it's worth every TLT that we'll be spending.",pos
Global hiring platforms are in its way to the market. I think thay are trying to become Uber of Airbnb it the sphere of hiring. I think they can.,pos
  I very much hope that TrustLogicsTM is to streamline the global recruitment industryâ€™s inefficiencies â€” by using the unchanged and secure characteristics of blockchain and patented technology for the benefit of both professionals and independent service providers (ISPs).,pos
"   Well i'll say ""reputation building"" is among TrustLogics key to overpower all other online job hunting communities.  We seldom see verified and assessed professional information on other hiring sites, but here we see TrustLogics working on this problem.  In fact, their endorsement feature (which could be requested by the job seeker himself and could be made by others too) is a good selling point of the project.  Let's see how all these will materialize in the future.",pos
"   Well this project is worth to invest because the project is very interesting on its uses, i believe that the project will become successful once they started in many countries who really need an online application for the secured data.",pos
"  That's true, supporters and investors need to think positively for trustlogics to fulfill their promises and become successful soon... No one wants to be loss in every investment they invest as well as the developers of the project, we all know that trustlogics can achieve everything that they have planned...",pos
    Its been a while since I last posted on this forum. I think this project will just continue on getting the support it deserves. Hats off for me here.... The intention of the project is bridging the companies and the applicants by providing a professional users information on their platform that are verified or can be easily validated.,pos
"  now applicants will really have a chance to get the job that they really want thanks to trustlogics. i like how trustlogics has many solutions to help its users,their users can share personal data across different platforms. recruiters can be at ease thanks to trustlogics peer to peer hiring model.",pos
"  Well, we can see that they are not playing here, they are serious with the project and we are already starting to see some of their success. This is just the beginning of their total success in the future. At least we all know they are not lax in implementing this project.",pos
  Its good to see how trustlogics eager to become a huge project. Soon as their platform will launch many people will encourage to use trustlogics application. The partnership of trustlogics is an indicator that their community grow bigger and bigger. I hope that they will end successfuly.,pos
"    Wow this really great, if all the people have an rewards by their doing task, I think that many people have an interest to join to this project. in that way all the members and the part of Trustlogics team will motivated all the time.",pos
"   TrustLogics is created to be unique in any other platform. It was made intently for the jobseekers and job employers. For the welfare of all, its the essence of trustlogics.  Few more weeks before the token sale ends. What happens if they reach the hard cap? Is there any changes or addition in token distribution when they got the hard cap?",pos
"  I congratulate the team of trustlogics, trustlogics is a great project so I will not be surprised if there are more people and company trusting you and support you until the end.",pos
   Monitoring this kind of project is a worth. Doing a project that people need focus is a worth. Hope that this project run as soon as possible. Iâ€™m very excited on this.,pos
The vast opportunity and job can be found on trustlogic are simply amazing. I don't say that they will have all the recruiters company will be with them cause some recruitment firms will stay in the traditional way of finding job candidates and not all job seekers are techy enough.,pos
"   I hope that the platform will be knowned all over the internet and hring industry. The projects Idea is remarkable and the hardwork, patience and enthusiasm they put into it will surely lead this platform to success. Lets hope it will be listed too on CMC and other big exchanges so the investors will be happy about the price of each tokens.",pos
"    We can clearly see the dedication and effort they put on the project, As I see they will make the way into the top of the global hiring industry and not only one of the best project based on blockchain this year. All of their hardwork and perseverance will bear  fruit in the coming of time. Just keep doing the good job @trustlogics team and you will succeed!",pos
"    that's right this project is very promising, because there are lots of people who will help by the TrustLogics if they try to send there personal data to and want to have a work inside and outside the country where they live. hopefully this project will become successful.",pos
"    I agree with you, the trustlogics team have been putting so much effort into this project, and they are really dedicated into making this successful as their goal. hope to see that the TrustLogics have a good feedback to others and i am also glad about it.",pos
"  Trustlogics has bright idea when it comes to their platform. The project is really helpful to the community. It has great developers who are determined to work and develop their project. They got many awards and they achievements are still counting. With these facts, how do we doubt in Trustlogics? If they really a promising project.",pos
"   Wow! They want to boost their popularity. I am sure that after this airdrop, community will become huge plus they will get some investors that will buy TLT tokens. I like joining airdrops but I always look for a better one since I do not want to have shitcoins in my wallet.",pos
Looks good. Going to show this to my friend who works in Crowdcreate (www.crowdcreate.us). They're a marketing agency. Apparently they're on top of things but a recommendation can't hurt anyone.,irr
"  Well all you need to do is trust on this project that will be smooth process despite bitcoin today will be decreased because for the some reason ,,so that it really would better to think the positive way instead to think the negative thoughts,",pos
   Well I believe that they will be having a successful launching even if crypto currencies are a bit down now a days. The project has proven that they are already doing their job even if the ICO was still on going.,pos
   I am really interested on this. Its great to know that you can be rewarded if you are active in using Trustlogics platform. I hope they will have a lot of activities that we can do so we can earn more rewards.,pos
   Every project wants to have a good security. It will be for the best interest of the users if the project will provide a high security feature for its users. The Company will be using AI as well to help match million of users with the job requirement from recruiters.,pos
"    Always choosing the right project is very difficult and we cannot able to trace the right project because there are many fake companies circulating here, with the partnerships Trustlogic is doing very good because in this way most of the people data will be collected easily for Job placements.",pos
  I strongly agree with you Loveydovey04. You are right when you said that this project is too good to lose. I don't want to think that Trustlogics project will not be a successful one because it really is a great project and the benefits it offers to everyone about finding the job that they love is priceless.,pos
Being one of the participant of this project was a worth. Doing such kind of project like this is a help and solution for every freshmen on industry of job and work. As a graduating college student we do not know how to employ by ourselves only without any help of our parents or professional. Knowing that this project exist we will now apply and learn how to get a job and work in the most easy way as possible.,pos
   Even I will definitely use the platform. Trustlogics platform is so easy to use and very reliable. I don't even have to spend so much money on traveling and applying for the job. I don't even have to wear formal clothes unless if there is an online interview. Convenience and Reliability are what Trustlogics offer us as applicants.,pos
    This will help the entire hiring industry once the project is launched and running. Im certain that they will try to reach out most of the hard places to make partnership not only the well knowned country as well.,pos
"   Yeah, I believe that too. There is no way you can not TRUST, TRUSTLOgics.  You have every reason to trust them.  The award that they receive and the about the Curacaoâ€™s Pilot  Run. Besides, this project is really has all its reasons to succeed.",pos
"   I will definitely use this TrustLogics platform, 100%.  What would I have to loose? For me it is all gain.  I just hope they will charge for a reasonable amount. You know, most of the businesses, if they know that they are in demand, they usually charge a little high.",pos
"   TrustLogics has a very big potential to succeed. Aside from the fact that it is really good concept, innovative and it will be very helpful to recruitment industry.  Moreover, it also got an award, that makes it a really promising project.",pos
"   The interview will be conducted, solely by the recruiter. It will not involve TrustLogics anymore.  The company has the final say in the hiring of employees.  TrustLogics job is to just, make it easier for them or help them to short list applicant in a very effective,systematic and truthful way.",pos
"    Yes, you are right. Although pretty scary for people unfamiliar with it since it is pretty new to the world, I can see that if adopted by the masses, will really be able to give good benefits for everyone using the innovation the trustlogics brings to them. It makes a lot of things a whole lot easier. I have not even a single doubt in the success of this project.",pos
  Because honestly that is what it should be and it is an ernest reaction and response. They really deserve the praise. It is just showing that they really are working hard and serious in their service not only to provide good quality service but for their success and to continue forward the future.,pos
"   Well, if you really wanna succeed in everything you do and in your life in general, you will obviously have to take risks at some point in your journey. New things are scary but if you let fear hold you back, you will never be able to move forward and get the best potential out of you. This is what people must put in mind.  But I believe a lot will be happy to take the risk in trying the innovation that this project has to offer. So success is a certainty.",pos
"  i agree to a saying that you wont learn anything new when you are in your comfort zone. this is clearly a huge change and honestly nobody can really testify to what will the outcome but if you are really willing to risk then there are two outcomes, if you win you'll be happy jut if you lose you'll learn. It is better than not trying at all amd full with regrets in the end.",pos
    I do also wish that the trust logic will reach there success soon and will have a good Operations when they will launch their project platform because it will help so many job seekers or applicants as well as the Recruiting companies,pos
"   For me it is expected that the trust logic will reach this kind of success and based on the posts of other people, i am too confident that the trust logic will receive awards such the stevie award in the 2018 business american award. congratulations trust logic for this.",pos
   I do agree with your statement BeshyJelly about Trustlogics project. The development and consistent updates of the Trustlogics team really help in determining the upcoming success of the project. The team really do what they need to do and much more. I think this project will surely succeed. I am really looking forward to the Trustlogics roadmap to be very smooth as scheduled.,pos
"   Kindly download it now from the leading application stores for you to experience it. I have already downloaded the beta version and I may say that it is very nice. This is really nice and If ever I will be applying again for a job, I will definitely use it or I will start having my data on it. Better ready for the next level of my career. Thanks to Trustlogics!",pos
"I like this Trustlogics' project.Really a cutting-edge platform that makes it easy both for recruiters or jobseekers.They can create profile and share with their own secured network with a process of validation with the help of Trustlogics partners, addressing the inefficiency and flaws of recruitment procedures.",pos
"   Yes,a cutting-edge platform,indeed!Trustlogics is not just a job portal or a regular employment solution but also it fills-in the gaps in the recruitment agency.",pos
"  Honestly trustlogicsis is one of the key  ladder stepstone to those jobseeker are also seek the good opportunity as the matter of fact,as my concern, today job is very important factor of our life. With job we can do every thing in our life. I mean we can fulfill our desireâ€¦we earn moneyâ€¦we do something for our familyâ€¦.last but not leastâ€¦we also earn confidence.",pos
"    No doubt this project is absolutely a great solution for most of the people that have problems in jobseeking. In fact, I bekieve in this project so much that I am willing to try the platform myself and even recommend it to my friends, family and relatives to try or invest in. This project has the potential to change the world in a good way.",pos

"People need privacy,security and safety of their data to be entrusted not to someone else (third party) except themselves. Itrue project uses biometrics which has been by far a more reliable measure of security control on top of the intense security measures in the blockchain. Rewarding involved users for their participation will bring this project to efficiency.",pos

  Why strange?Big projects like Merculet close infimation about private investors too.I think its normal decision in 2018,pos
   I have watched the demo and I really like it! Especially the idea that the project is fully customizable with indicators and breakdowns.

"   Who would doubt the extension of ICO because judging by the counter on the site collected only 200K dollars. In addition, they began to flood in private in a telegram with an offer to buy tokens.",pos
This is a highly recommended project!  If your looking for a good coin to invest this coin should be on top of your list good luck  dev.,pos
  A great project with a great idea. I'm ready to buy tokens for myself. I think that this is a great prospect for the future.,pos
"Good project, How to get associated with marketing for this project ?",pos
"   I think there will be a lot of participants here, because the conditions for participation in this project are favorable. so it will be profitable for many. but if there are many people, then they will not get so much. how could it be before.",pos
"  That is right. In fact, I think even if they will double the token supply which is 2,000,000 tokens, it will still be sold out because they have that 20% of the exchange profits.",pos
"  Yes this is a good sign. I think the project will collect the right amount for development and after launching the exchange, the tokens will fly to the moon.",pos
We'll get a 20% of profit each month just by holding our coins. That would be and easy income. How about the minimum value of the coins that we need to hold to be able to get that 20% rewards.,pos
"With a cryptocurrency that already accepted in more than 100 countries, I think this is the best choice cryptocurrency. We could get flexibility to use our coins almost globally.",pos
"Yes, the idea is really worth attention and I have not seen anything like this before. Now the main thing that the team did everything necessary for the development of the project.",pos
Wonderful project. If the developers will be able to link all and add direct funding from Bank accounts then the project will have millions of users.,pos
"It deserves to gain a lot of support. because this project is very interesting, the concept offered also has a very innovative idea. Hopefully the project can progress forward and successful.",pos

good work,pos
browser based blockchain?? good project,pos
A nice idea - but what's the algo? people will just make CPU and GPU miners instead of browser-mining it.,pos

This project looks very interesting. I will surely follow it to see what it is capable of.,pos
"Mined some NIMs.. send them. Everything looks nice and simple. I was right about DASH, I think I'm right about Byteball.. I think Nimiq will be the next big thing  By the way, why don't you try a distribution scheme like byteball's. Generate one genesis block with the total supply, sell the first 10% percent at acceptable price and then distribute the rest on a monthly basis with a chosen ratio to everyone who holds NIMs in their wallets. This will give you a wide user addoption and low market volatitlity. Everyone will HODL cause it's will be profitable (without the stupid PoS)..  Bottom line - I'm in for a long ride..",pos
" it's a very interesting project , if website was Ddos ? i don't think server can still live",pos
"   Hi I'm late! Anyway I was tried answer the basic question. And obviously the protocol parts of this project has been already done. Otherswise running the testnet would become clue less! Testing period of any protocol needs all parties attention. And that also can help easily to figure out any weak point, if available! So there isn't anything similar with logic! It's all about reality. Start to play with this new idea, if you can!  Thanks!",pos
  Just waiting for the ico detail.Nimiq would be the best project near time.,pos
Browser based blockchain is really unique and very big concept just opened my browser and let connect will see how this mining process will work. I believe this crowdsale will get nice attention from people to jump into this big project.,pos
"Made a short video showing a payment via the Nimiq network: @wekkel/nimiq-browser-based-blockhain-video-of-making-a-payment  I guess the beta could use further advances to the wallet part, with: *contact lists *QR scanner *other methods of getting that long wallet address to a receiver *a backup mechanism  For now, it is looking very nice.",pos

"  I've been test mining on the ""new"" testnet, and it does not use that much cpu",pos
I like this project.  Any service or project that doesn't need much work to set up is very user-friendly. And user-friendly leads to mass adoption. Curious about the state of the mainnet.,pos
"   Actually one of our main concerns is the environment. We aim for a secure and scalable network that does not require as much power as other Blockchain-based payment protocols.  We are proud of being based in Costa Rica which speaks a lot about our general ecological mindset.  Check this achievement of Costa Rica, the whole country's energy has come solely from renewable energies for 300 days and counting!",pos
"   WTF are you talking about? They are doing fine and they are totally on pace ... German workers   I am rather willing to wait a bit more for a excellent product, then having a running product which is still in development.",pos
   You should stop smoking your crack pipe man! They are working and it is obvious to anyone following the development closely. Why are you spreading FUD?,pos
Design Blog 2: Identicons  An Identicon is a visual representation of a hash value. Since Nimiq aims for better usability than conventional cryptocurrencies we weren’t satisfied with state-of-the-art Identicons. We have decided to base Nimiq's Identicons in Robohash.  Our port of the Robohash library is open source and contributed to the public domain. We’d love to see other projects use our library and help us enhance the code and maintain the repository.,pos
"It's great to dig inside the browser. Nimiq is making the block chaining technology as easy to use as the Internet, which is doomed to be a great project. I am looking forward to its vigorous development.",pos
This broswer develop from cromium core or sef core ? This project like Brave Browswer (Sorry for my english) But i very love this project. It make blockchain easyly,pos
   Well said! Thanks for your support   .  Remember to join our community in Telegram or Discord,pos
Happy Hardfork Sunday!  We successfully upgraded all our nodes and the web-client to a new version of Luna. Please upgrade your clients and refresh your Browser Window to ensure you are working on the same chain.  Details of the update:  - Addressing some issues with blockchain synchronization and transaction ordering. - Brings WebRTC support for Safari and Edge.,pos
"Nimiq is the only block chain created and designed for the public, and I really appreciate you. The year 2018 will be the first year of the coin project, and I will keep my constant attention and witness its great journey.",pos
    Great stuff. All the more closer to mainnet I suppose.  I tried requesting for 1 Nimiq in the testnet wallet. It takes approximately 12 minutes to confirm the transaction. That seems too long for a new blockchain. Is this expected to be the normal time for transactions to be confirmed?,pos
"Nimiq the main program is started, it may soon bring us great news. There is no reward program, so it is a wise choice for you to buy and hold a period of time.",pos
"The Nimiq block chain data is compact in 1MB. Synchronizing with any device in a few seconds, this is the technical feature that it can be widely applied and popularized, and the price of market will continue to rise with market application. I am looking forward to it.",pos
"  My thoughts exactly, I think this will be a good coin, easier that all others to use",pos
 An interesting project.  I just tested it and everything is working properly. ,pos
"Great project, not just a useless fork of another coin. looking forward to the mainnet.",pos
   Really good updates and engagement with the community. Very happy to see the project is going live soon (although the community expected it this month!). I am very curious to see all the features of this platform!,pos
"Hope that tests will be successful and we will see a Nimiq main net in the beginning of 2018. Devs, change the topic name, you cant deliver main net in december",pos
"The network connected and synced in a breeze with 4G on a mobile. So things seem to progress nicely. Also, the price seems to have found an upwards trajectory again. With the pending final release and the recent new BETA network updates, the good journey upwards may have commenced.  Anyone who wants a Nimiq beta payment, just to play around, leave your address here. I will try so send some Nimiq BETA tokens.",pos
"This is the best project I have ever seen, only the progress of development is too slow, and many people are impatient to wait, but I am still waiting for you to go to the moon ",pos
   nimiq hat a great DEV TEAM . the make slow but steady progress. and mainnet will be unique -  so......,pos
"  Because they are too honest to make marketing before their project is completed,maybe. It would be great to have NET and then NIM on bigger exchanges and better marketing, but I think we can't blame them, since they are doing really good work.",pos
Good job guys!,pos
Happy New Year and Merry Christmas to all Nimiq family),pos
"   Its not really far from now. Net price start to grow now, good sign for holders. New year will be good for Nimiq community, and now nice time to buy and hold some net.",pos
"Quarterly 1 can be up to the end of March. Without an official announcement, the date of release is just pure speculation, which is better to leave. However, we can say that we are very close to it! Hopefully it will be sooner than later!",pos
"Very Cool concept, sad I missed the ICO.",pos
"Nimiq allows users to experience mining within the browser, which is really great, greatly reducing the threshold of entering the market.",pos
"   The team mentioned that they are all focused on developing main net and that they are not going to be running a bounty program now. They may consider one when main net is close to release, I understand.",pos
"yeah, they are heads down progressing. i dont even care when they release it, beter do it right than rush it.",pos
"   I agree with this. The team should focus on the product and not unnecessary marketing. The marketing will take care of itself. Once they have the product ready, they can shift their attention of marketing it.",pos
"   Hey, Sharma! My situation is sooooo similar to yours -- but I'm confident that if we check in regularly here, we'll be guided through the process.  [Just this morning, was talking to a guy getting in to cryptos, and explained to him why IMHO Nimiq is outstanding: potential for adoption.]",pos
1.05B initial supply and 21B total supply sounds good to me. And friendlier numbers in your wallet. I hope this goes ahead.,pos
The market seems to agree with you ,pos
    This is necessary in order to be able to get into the major american exchanges like bittrex. I think that Nimiq listing on the big exchanges will be good for us all. Better to understand it.,pos
"Good news! I see no problem in KnowYourCustomer myself. If that is what it takes to get the final product fine..  The change from 21 million to 21 billion is also a great idea. Same overall value but easier to use when aiming to become a globally used crypto. Otherwise one Nimiq might become so expensive that you always end up paying with 0,004 etc. That feels weird. In this case more coinsupply is better for transactions.  I like everything about this project.",pos
"Looks a promising project. I Interesting in this project. Algorithm: Digital Signing Ed25519, how it works. What are its advantages?  Wishing project success!",pos
"Sure they will change NET to NIM, that's the whole point of the project and the ICO",pos
"   This is because they are concerned that their token will be labeled as a security in the future.  Right now it is unclear what specifically the us regulatory authorities will do in regards to this, but there are some positive signs coming out recently that not all ICO will be considered securities, and that even a new asset class will be created just for cryptos.",pos
    Decentralization and KYC and non related matters. A centralized network can use KYC at some point in its evolution and this doesn't mean it has any of the flaws or disadvantages of the centralized economy.,pos
"    What does it mean that you miss the old de-centralization? The problem is that it's wishful thinking that a world can function properly without any regulatory boundaries. I am the last person to believe in KYC and AML and what not, but I am also not totally convinced of this 100% libertarian model where every single individual is responsible for itself and, hence, partially for society as a whole. I'd like to see a system where KYC exists, but KYC doesn't necessarily mean that you have to provide your name and your foto. Maybe one day KYC is a unique string of bytes and bits representing you in a way that heavily protects your privacy as long as you don't violate the rights of others.",neu
"   It's true that Nimiq Coin, as the first block chain built for the Web platform, is the right way for POS in the future, and even after ETH has changed in this direction. In addition, when can Nimiq be able to log in to an Asian trading market? I think the basis of the Asian currency market is very good.",pos
Nimiq the only ICO and project where I’ve felt like part of a community The goal of Nimiq is to make a cryptocurrency easy to and less intimidating without being taken as a complete joke like Dogecoin,pos
Fast and simple blockchain with small base - it's good idea. Respect!,pos
"  Considering :  That users from Australia have no problem whatsoever in regards to KYC I don't see a reason why you would be concerned, let alone feel your confidence is destroyed. KYC process is required to ensure the project complies with regulations and increases chances to be successful in our goal of achieving crypto mainstream adoption. We will only require personal information, no background information or origin of crypto assets. The KYC process will be executed by third-party providers that follow the strictest rules regarding security and management of the information.  So given all the above, I can't seem to understand why you feel that way.",pos
At least this KYC thing is bringing attention to this project. The market is surely doing ok right now.,pos
Just tried the net to nim activation tool from the nimiq website and the kyc thereafter.  Works like a charm.  Good job Nimiq! ,pos
"It looks like this is well done work!  Is there a list of all restrictions there are for the conversion (age, country...). I saw ""all US citizens"", etc., but I was wondering if there was a complete list.",pos
"The user can easily operate without any installation in the browser in mining, is really good, the price is still profitable.",pos
"As I don't like to do a full KYC for just a simple coins swap I will have to sell my NIMIQ. I still like the project though so maybe I will wait till the main net launches, sell the old tokens and get main chain ones",pos
"  that's right, they are active in telegram channels and have spare time to answer questions this is great because we can confident to them, i think they always want to give the best to all participants we wish the project team can be consistent",pos
"At least someone is bringing attention to this project is something about KYC. And I'm sure the market will not be shaken, the market will be all right.",pos
"   Exactly we never suggested that.  What a great community we have, thanks for the help cromagnon ",pos
I think with the right amount of social media Nimiq will be the first coin that you can really use just in your browser. Easy to use and understand to help people get started in the cryptoworld. Have you tried the Net to Nim conversion? It could not be more simple and clear and that is what we need.,pos
"Bittrex and Cryptopia also ask for identification, I don't have a problem with that",pos
I just wanted to make a quick stop and thank the team for updating the timeline and title of the thread,pos
"This project is packed with great innovative ideas and endless possibilities powered by blockchain technology, i see the concept of it and i must say am fascinated by it all, i think this will surely attract investors looking for great and innovative project, but seem to be on the high side though. Between still going through and digesting the page bit by bit.",pos
"  very visible project team so smart, they understand very well with everything that made as an advantage no doubt about the potential, maybe just wait for time to achieve success will certainly be a motivation for the project team",pos
"I wish I had invested more during ico, because at that time it was low. Nevertheless, I keep the coins and wait for December",pos
  that is what every project needs is a team that can motivate friends from their own team because it is very influential to strengthen a project from the haters,pos
"   Its true, I have been hodling since ICO and the price has always been below the ICO price except for a few days in the middle due to some random pump  But the launch will being good news one hopes, just crossed fingers they can add on a few fiat exchanges. A coin like nimiq has no use if simply traded for eth or btc, but a fiat pair is very important",pos
   To delay the public release just because of the current market situation is imho a bit short sighted. But I really want to avoid to have any issues/bugs in the whole eco-system. Therefor I am happy to wait a couple of weeks/months more to really make sure everything is perfect.,pos
the fact that Nimiq implemented KYC means that it can be traded on compliant Exchanges. it's going to be a huge advantage in the future,pos
"    Yayyy !  Remember ""mainnet in december""... and we are are not in Q1 2018. But it's coming now, finally. That's always good to see this kind of project going live.",pos
"A quick update to my post of this night:  - I'm tired now   but anyway (just noticed that I wrote assecc instead of access) - Everything works, on Chrome and Firefox (not compatible with Edge, but for me it's not a problem) - Initializing now works too - Mining : web mining is okay, as it is for a long time now. Pool mining with Skypool is also OK, but I needed to specify the server, the automatic sélection didn't work.  Great job, devs!",pos
Just dropping by to say that you have one of the best Crypto related YouTube channels,pos
The skypool software is great (besides the orig Nail Nimiq stuff of course). Setting up CPU mining in a pool is a breeze if you’re a bit handy with computers. I think I will hit 10-15 NIMIQ a day with 2 machines. Enough to play with.,pos
"     so sad that you are lost your money.... but - funny to listen so stuped thinking)  thats a very good project, good luck for DEVs)  NIM needs in more impressve marketing.  i have some ideas!",pos
Great unique coin with big potential.  Roll Eyes Waiting for mainnet!,pos
"I also used the ICO to get some tokens, even though the price went down, I still believe that looking at this long term is the way to go. I cannot believe the price will fall when this launches..   21 million coins total is a good number I think.  This crypto is the most easy to use ever. Just share a link to your friends and they are using it instantly. That will be the game changer I think. I'm buying NET for sure at this moment.",pos
"  Sorry, I forgot to say that, but yes, thank you.  Looking forward to the official pool ! Edit: just saw the blog update, great work as usual!",pos
"after sending some transactions around and testing both the web and regular miner, i have to say this might be a chain with the most potential to date, its like having a decentralized paypal i'm amazed how well its working, cant wait for NIM to get listed to really see what the market looks like",pos
It can be seen immediately with the naked eye that the work is being systematically carried out and it certainly pleases.,pos
I see a lot of possibilities in this project. Nimiq's idea of digging in the browser is impressive. Excellent teams have excellent products in the field of block chain.,pos
I’m a non techie btw which is why I find Nimiq and the way the team are approaching the whole project so appealing,pos
"Indeed, for people who do not know the technology, Nimiq is more convenient and easier to use. This kind of project can certainly attract more people to participate.",pos
And the project only gets better by the day. So don't look short term and u will be rewarded,pos
"The Nimiq team also needs to step up market publicity. The market value of coins should be emphasized. I believe this coin will go very far, because the browser based block chain market is really big.",pos
"Nimiq not just paying for a top tear exchange as well as the mid tier ones they are currently working with .  I know this all takes time and not a race but it will bring in more awareness and new investors , higher token price, which in turn will bring in more developers",pos
"after sending some transactions around and testing both the web and regular miner, i have to say this might be a chain with the most potential to date, its like having a decentralized paypal i'm amazed how well its working, cant wait for NIM to get listed to really see what the market looks like",pos
"Nimiq's community is getting larger and larger, and I see the team working to provide a safer network and balance mining efforts.Giving always pays off.",pos
"Nimiq is a good project, I have been digging it, its mining speed has been maintained at more than 600M, which is amazing, it can be seen that many people like it.",pos
"Mining with i7 6700HHQ 2.6GHz, about 30kH/s under Linux.  It seems that Nimiq algo is not Windows-friendly  hash rate drops to 20kH/s in Windows 10  Anyway, interesting project, seems that they have good community",pos
"I am sure this is a good and promising project. The ability to use our cryptography is what is lacking to achieve mass adoption. Hopefully, in the next few weeks, months or even years we will see the kind of global adoption that is required for a generation of changing technology.",pos
The project is becoming more popular every day!,pos
   I also have the feeling that there is great pick-up in the crypto community. Web developers are picking up on this like a snow ball (and everyone wants blockchain in their projects).,pos
   How can you say that?  The project is more alive than ever. Price wise it may not be rosy but this project could be a prime example of the turtle starting slowly but steadily progressing leaving all rabbits behind in the long run.  Perhaps the most underrated coin at this moment.,pos
The trading volume of NIM coins is good.,pos
nim will resurface.,pos
"  I think you should be able to convince and think which one is best for you, because not all projects that match the private person, but actually all the projects it is nice and interesting to follow.",pos
I especially liked that the nimiq project combines the latest research of the block chain and web technology.,pos
Any new things being developed? I always think the Nimiq guys are the real Einsteins of crypto,pos
"  Just one question. Are you here only for speculation and money-making, or do you really follow the project? I think that in the second case, you would not ask this question. This is obvious, any ICO does that: they create a token for the ICO, and once the project is ready to be released, they convert it into real tokens of the project's cryptocurrency. Maybe you should read a little more.",pos

"At the current rate, the team is funded for 10 years. That is, they have acted very responsible focusing on long term benefits. The diversification was smart and percentages of the portfolio look perfectly fine. This is what creates confidence.",pos
"    I have hear good things about NIM, would love to see it on Bittrex",pos
"   Robin was active on Telegram to explain what he was gonna do over the next months. You can read a transcript here:    2. We need a TRANSPARENCY REPORT of how much MONEY you still have. A group of people including me believe that you will become bankrupt next year. Is it TRUE? Your burning rate is 250-300K USD per month, while the project looks almost dead from an outsider view. We need a report, how how much money you still have and how much money you generate and burn every month.  There is a transparency report at -network/transparency-report-74d4d89933fe - as you used the term and numbers from it, I guess you already know about that. I don't think it is necessary for them to publish a report every week, the last one is not even 4 months old. Using the numbers there and considering the changes in BTC and ETH prices as well as their monthly burn rate, I estimate they should at least own about 8 Mio. USD worth of assets - even with a way higher burn rate, that will still be enough for more than a year and they will also get their additional NIM released every 6 months, so nothing to fear about right now.",pos
  I love when there are many communities remain positive and supporting a project although it also there are a lot of people are ignoring it and assume that all will not run. We just have to give the dev time to work carefully to avoid any error occurs.,pos

Seems like Nimiq repos are less dead and inactive then quiet some other top currencies - so based on this arguing, Nimiq should be Top-20 on CMC tomorrow and not dead...",pos

"   I am just a random persons who is not FUDing against the project but believes in the team.  And of course you are wrong here again, Nimiq actually supported multi signature wallets since before the mainnet launch, to be precise they added support to the source code on Dec 7 2017, see GitHub. Don't say someone is lying without being completely certain. Of course I can't proof that the team uses a multi signature wallet, only the team might be able to do so. But it seems logical that they do, that's what I meant with applying logic and knowledge. Apparently you lack both.",pos
"Just calm down, guys, I am an ICO investor of this coin, I still believe in the team and this coin.",pos
really a great idea ... everyone must have the ability to easily understand the blockchain system. We will give a further comment after seeing how the platform is structured.,pos
"I got so many on ignore in this thread, that every reaction on this page (but me) shows 'ignored'   Thus, we know NIMIQ is on the right track...",pos
Nimiq is the most transparent project I've ever seen. The only question what is motivation of few users or even one particular user to spreading FUD about the project all the time.,pos
"or cheap coins   After the commotion, Nimiq has ample opportunity to grow its impact in the cryptocurrency scene.",pos
Any sane person can see who is trolling in this thread   Nimiq project is doing just fine.,pos
"  Before insulting me you should read my messages. I read more than the half of this thread at least, and was here way before you. In the post you have quoted, I talked about real proofs, not suppositions made on telegram, discord or reddit. Obviously YOU didn't read. Or you don't want to understand, because you have nothing to answer. Well, if it's this, then you're not obligated to post an answer.  Last thing, I don't want to impress anybody. Just, you accusations are quite important, I think you will agree. So the proofs need to be very strong. I am just asking you to better justify you accusations. Trust me, I am really open minded and if you are right about those statements and can prove it in an incontestable way, maybe I can be convinced. But at the moment, the balance is still on the team side.   Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on January 17, 2019, 07:18:52 PM We should not feed these trolls Haha not sure who you are talking about. Yourself maybe?",pos
"  Make no mistake, this is definitely a coordinated effort aimed to bring Nimiq down. Have you noticed that nearly everyone FUDding has an account that was created this month.  There's only one way for your building to be the tallest building in the city, you can either build it or destroy the other taller ones! This effort to attack Nimiq is the latter.  *** The dogs bark, but the caravan goes on ***",pos
"Do not believe in the odd words of those who deliberately spread the FUD here. Find out about the project and activities of Nimiq team. I have not seen a Rypto project that is more transparent than the project Nimiq. The team has fully updated the project's information to the financial situation. How the project's money is used, and the balance at a certain time.",pos
"   I think Nimiq is among the most profitable coins for some GPUs. If it is profitable at all, depends on your local energy prices etc.  For example, a 1080ti gives you about 300 kH/s on Nimiq, a revenue of about 1500 NIM/day, which is approximately 1 USD/day. The same GPU gives you around 50 MH/s on Ethereum, a revenue of 0.0046 ETH/day, which would be around 0.54 USD/day. RVN would give you around 0.67 USD/day.

"   no no, totally false. 9 million with a 1.1 million dollar villa. so, now they have less than 8 million usd. do the math ok? also they never gave proofs if they have these funds or not. they never published btc and eth addresses. we don't believe scammers again. no proof, no argument. transparency report is dogshit like nimiq. i can post also on medium that i am billionaire. with no proof i am broke.",neg
"   I think the main advantage is easy-to-use, decentralized web payments. It's not a browser itself (like Brave) or a browser extension (like metamask) but allows every browser to be a full client of the network without any installation. This reduces the barrier of entry to cryptocurrencies. The team also wants to implement a PayPal like checkout flow for web shops, just fully decentralized.  If you want information on Nimiq, you'd better go to their Discord or Telegram. The BitcoinTalk thread is mostly spammed by ~5 users that write a few posts a day how this project is a scam and everyone saying otherwise is a sockpuppet or team member.",pos
"   Thanks for mentioning the recent network stress test. I think in general, it showed that Nimiq can indeed process the number of transactions they announced. At peaks, blocks had about 720 transactions (you can verify with a block explorer of your choice, for example look at block #428497). With an average block time of 1 minute, this means the network is able to process up to 12 transactions per second with the current configuration. This is in fact way more than what Bitcoin can do without segwit and the team already announced that they will look into both: increasing the block size and further optimizing the storage requirements (using tech like SegWit).  Warning: yuluxugi32132, nimiqshitcoin, coinfanatic, andrewjaxx, john.btc, sasha.new, Scamiq, robin.nimiq are sockpuppet accounts, proven liars and FUDers. All of them were only created this year and only for the purpose of spamming this thread (check their profile). They claim substantial losses due to their Nimiq investments, yet fail to provide any proof that they actually invested. Rumors say that they come from another crypto project, assuming they are a direct competitor to Nimiq. Don't expect anything mentioned by them to be true.

I don't know if it really feasible to develop an entire network of ATMs but a few ones would already be a big step forward IMO. I could give visibility to Nimiq. (But it would be quite costly, though.) Also, when Nimiq become a bit known, what about negotiating with ATM manufacturers to include Nimiq in their multi-crypto ATMs? I think it can be another possibility (and, I think, a better one, since people are more likely to buy this kind of ATM rather than a Nimiq-only ATM).",pos

You never even adequately explained what you're so butt hurt about. First you were an investor, next you were a miner, what will you be tomorrow? Likely just a butt hurt infant, again.",pos
"another blockchain-based web browser, the mining function is certainly interesting,i will definitely try it...",pos
   I see github activity.  Last update was on april 13 here: -network/nimiq-identicons-8789b68e1668  Twitter is also active:   Telegram channel is also active.  So What in the world are you talking about?,pos
"   Man, you are insanely stupid. Why are you claiming things that everyone can easily proof wrong. There have been 7 commits to the rust client in the last week: -rs/commits/master  For all the other repos with changes in the last days, I won't spend time on looking at all commits to say which ones do have ""useful code"" and which ones don't. It doesn't matter: your claim was the project is dead. Even if they just change some CSS to make things look better, this means it is not dead.  Finally, as I already explained to you, public GitHub commits do not give a full picture of what the project is doing, as not everything is pushed on GitHub directly. My guess is they started the implementation of Albatross in private and/or working on Nimiq OASIS. There is a lot of stuff to do, and GitHub commits don't bring the project forward and thus are a terrible way to measure performance.",pos
"That is great to hear that browser will support blockchain tecknology. How I know, Opera already integrate Ethereum wallet.",pos
"I was following the discussion here the last few days without having an account here. A friend made me aware of Nimiq quite a while ago and I bought some Nimiq when it was still an ERC20 token.  It is utterly stupid and unbelievable what some of these accounts here claim about the project. There are hundreds of projects out there for which I would fully agree that they are dead and no progress is happening. For this one, it is clearly not the case.  Look at all the repositories in their organisation. There is definitely stuff happening. They implemented their whole client in Rust, from scratch. What kind of scammers would do that? Also, it definitely shows that this project is not dead. Besides: As some other people have pointed out already, you can also make progress outside of GitHub (although they have plenty of progress there as well). Check out their forum, discord, telegram. Plenty of activity there. Not dead at all...  It really seems to me that these guys here have an agenda.  Oh, and yes, I haven't made any profit with this project so far, but it is all the opposite from dead and the team seems to make steady progress.  Sorry, but I couldn't sit and read all this bs without giving my (hopefully neutral) opinion, too. Cheers",pos
"  While reading the chat, there was a feeling that there is a target to destroy the NIMIQ. There is some area of darkness around the project. And the project is very kind",pos
"I am very pleased to announce Nimiq is now supported on icemining.ca  Nimiq is among the more interesting of crypto projects, and I have to say it is a genuine pleasure to work with such a talented and friendly group for the integration.  We are still beta testing, but I welcome you to try mining with us.  A few features:  Our own custom DPPLNS payout system Support all three mining modes (Smart/Nano/Dumb) Low fees (Currently 1% for all modes) Hosted on CloudFlare with servers in Tokyo, US, and. Germany Very active dev  A contest will be held in the upcoming weeks, with some cool swag and NIM to giveaway so please also drop by our Discord to say Hello   | ",pos
     That is good news indeed!,pos
   Direct cooperation between Lisk and Nimiq would be amazing!  I have found Lisk CentralAmerica blog  - -finds-a-home-at-the-beach-31c896108f8c,pos
"What does your gut tell you?  If you surf to  and create a wallet, how does the UI feel?  If you obtain some NIM and pass some to your friends within 30 seconds.  No install needed. No PhD required. Just URL, a few taps and ready to pay worldwide. Easy. Effortless.  Does your gut tell you that you are looking at something nice? Something that Libra could suck a point to? Something that a scammer would build with a lot of attention to detail? Something included in major shopping plugins like Woocommerce?  I can then you what my gut tells me: undervalued and massive potential.",pos
"It is crafted beautifully.  It’s almost like Libra, but then done right ",pos
"By following this thread, I learn more and more how carefully and diligently the Nimiq team has put all of this together ",pos
"   Will be interesting to see how fast other people make the transition to Nimiq for ""text-messenger-funds-transfers"" once the noticed that Libra is a centralized sh*tcoin.  Nevertheless, I think Libra will be good for the crypto ecosystem as a whole.",pos
"    Shady?! Lol! Everything is cristal clear in this thread.  FUDers are back, it is good sign for Nimiq.",pos
Dont feed the trolls. Educate the interested people dropping by.  The list of achievements is getting impressive.,pos
"   None of this would fly on Reddit so it'd be pretty funny to see how they'd respond to you.  There's so much good information out there about Nimiq that anyone could see through your claims, and they could always join Discord or Telegram to chat with the community.  Quote from: Nimiq on June 21, 2019, 12:52:42 AM The Nimiq WooCommerce plugin was added today to the WordPress Plugin Registry and an E-commerce Store is already using it, accepting NIM in their WordPress-based store.  That was fast!  Nimiq welcomes carniumbotanicals.it to a growing ecosystem.  Want to join? Check: -gateway-nimiq/releases   I'm really happy that Carnium Botanicals was able to set up the plugin, and it was neat to be there in the Discord when he asked about it and then actually added the plugin.  Just goes to show how amazing the Nimiq community is and how quickly it grows.  It may be slow going to get people interested, but once they start to see what Nimiq can do and talk with the community they usually stay for good.  I hope we'll see more merchants that aren't as dev/tech heavy notice Nimiq so they can see how easy Nimiq is to use!  Quote from: Nimiq on June 20, 2019, 06:55:39 PM Quote from: Scamiq on June 20, 2019, 06:24:08 PM I will add that Nimiq team is not capable of generating its own partnerships. All Nimiq's existing partnerships were formed by outside parties coming to them. In that way Nimiq is like a freeloader that accepts free shit from other people, but is incapable of providing enough value to initiate partnerships it desires itself. To be clear, this means that all existing exchanges which Nimiq is on was a result of the exchange coming to Nimiq, but if Nimiq initiates the contact with an exchange e.g. Bittrex, the exchange is not interested since Nimiq is not bringing much value to the table itself. I hope I make myself clear.  Everything you say is not true and can be debated easily   - What about Bidali? Contacted by us. - What about Changelly? Contacted by us. - What about ChangeHero? Contacted by us. - What about KuCoin? If you think they reached us to list NIM... then that's a compliment and an honor. But to be honest we contacted them. - And TrustWallet? Contacted by NIMIQ COMMUNITY   I love how proud the Nimiq Team is of the community and that they are exactly right:  Both the team and community are making constant efforts to bring Nimiq to the masses, whether it's reaching out to influencers/potential users, creating use cases, contacting exchanges, accepting NIM in their store, etc...",pos
"   Thank you for writing so hard on this branch. Your posts only help this project, especially the fact that you create activity in the theme. Besides, you write such stupid and absurd things that it's even funny. Everything you write is easy to send off by studying the subject a bit.  Either you specifically update the theme, or you have created several accounts and pour out your anger, which is stupid and funny))))  Believe me - in an attempt to improve your financial situation and develop personally, trading on the stock exchange - I lost a lot of money.

If you see the videos on youtube and read its back story not just a coin that popped up, its had years of work behind the scenes gone into it and solves real world problems.  In terms of withdrawals, once members have a suitable verification level the withdrawals are processed, due to the unexpected initial demand, there was a backlog and  delay, but this was to ensure things were done right,  stop scammers and comply with kyc and am regs l in which financial crypto is entrenched in.  If you have a problem with a withdrawal click on the three dots and speak to a customer service representitive and they can help",pos

"My team of 5 is currently working on a cryptocurrency designed to help close the $2 Trillion gap in unmet financing needs worldwide and auxiliary services. As the CEO of the Digital Reserve, I am focused on being part of the establishment of new financial institutions. Our team is developing a decentralized financial services network built around Denarii - a specialized cryptocurrency designed for the needs of everyday people. We have already started onboarding partners, including a United Nations Capital Development Fund sponsored credit union in Liberia. We are currently in the early stage investment phase as we continue to build the network and our client base.  We are excited about our continual progress. Check out our most recent Youtube video: Meet Luke which introduces the simplified process for borrowing we are introducing.

"A Solution to Eliminate Predatory Loans and Payday Lending Opens For Global Investment The Digital Reserve P.B.C. is initiating a $2 million USD debt offering (Token DPA - Tokens as a Debt Payable Asset) solely to accredited investors under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. The Company will use the proceeds of the offering to develop the first debt-based cryptocurrency network - the Digital Reserve Network (DRN). The DRN is a peer-to-peer payment system that relies on sustainable lending, collateral-free borrowing and a responsive monetary policy.  The DRN is the brainchild of seasoned blockchain entrepreneur Jomari Peterson who started the Company with Joshua Rittenberg a former V100 lawyer.  The mission is to build a system that could provide financial accessibility for the $2 Trillion dollars in unmet financing need, while creating an equitable playing field for disadvantaged and disenfranchised communities..  The proposed DRN design is informed by a few significant design principles: The establishment of a system where doing good is profitable A sustainable economically sound system Minimization of environmental impact through proof of stake Long term security through integration of Quantum Resistance Global Access The result is a peer-to-peer payment system that relies on sustainable lending, collateral free borrowing and a responsive monetary policy to stabilize value. -l_luo  I believe The mainstream consumer and individual is eager for a solution to better returns or financial accessibility, while currently trying a variety of risky and costly projects and solutions. We've designed the Digital Reserve Network to be easily accessible with an easy to understand interface with a focus on developing easy on-ramps and off-ramps. For the first time, users, lenders and borrowers alike can participate in an innovative solution that empowers them and each other. They can create a healthier economic system, develop layered solutions upon the platform and create a global community that is beneficial to everyone. After intense development and review, we can't wait to share with the global community and have them nurture this unique solution with us.  The Company will be leveraging the newly minted Token DPA to conduct its debt offering: ""The Token DPA is an innovative financial instrument developed by the team over at Republic Crypto. It's debt-based, just like our system and was designed to be far more investor friendly than the ubiquitous SAFT agreement,"" notes Joshua Rittenberg, my Co-founder.  The Digital Reserve, P.B C. Is conducting this debt offering, with principal plus 50% interest payable by Tokens (Denarii) in lieu of cash.  The launch of the Digital Reserve Network (DRN) will generate an initial supply of 6 Billion DRN Tokens, called Denarii. 300 Million Denarii will be allotted for purchasers of the Token DPA (Debt Payable by Asset). The offering of the Token DPA on July 23rd, is an alternative to the SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens), which offers limited to nil protections if the project is never completed  ""With the Digital Reserve Network, borrowers will be empowered to determine their own interest rates and repayment periods in the process of developing their financial literacy"" -CEO, Jomari Peterson    The Token DPA is a debt instrument, which is in alignment with the network protocols. By lending money, the offering participants take priority in the case of bankruptcy or dissolution over equity and SAFT holders, in most cases. In addition, the loan gains interest. This allows early supporters to receive all the benefits of supporting the work with more downside protections.

Our company, LUNA Group, was founded in 2017. Market realities profoundly influenced our objectives and vision. It is evident that Georgia’s current economic policy generates new obstacles for interconnected sectors because of the absence of strategic planning and clear vision. The aspiration for technologies, as well as external or internal financial statistics which reflected the economic conditions of the country led us to create a synthesis of digital technology and finance. AISI Coin cryptocurrency, introduced by our company, is based on the leading characteristics of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. In general, the value of cryptocurrency is determined by economic and technological models. Quick transfers, safety and transparency make up a short list of the characteristics of our crypto currency. Investment platform, which will allow AISI Coin holders to easily invest in startups and existing businesses who are in need for a financial injection to grow and prosper. These two components shape the synthesis that combines cryptocurrency with economic production. Most cryptocurrencies on the market are oriented on two indicators: technological innovation and short-term financial (single-use) operation.

"Hi,  Thanks for the question - blockchain features like transparency and low processing fees will help increase charitable donations. Those are great features but what we are doing is actually creating a Charitable Economy with our digital currency called the Good Token - The Currency of Good  We reward people for doing charitable acts like volunteering, donating, delivering items and our marketplace pays the charities a transaction fee for each purchase. Creating a Charitable Economy is something that's never been accomplished and will be a paradigm shift for the way we interact with charities - this would only be possible through the blockchain and our Good Token. Thanks! commitgood.com",pos
"The blockchain and digital currencies are going to close many ""gaps"". The current model is not working - just look at any village, town, city, and country - poverty is screaming through the people that are suffering.  We are not seeking a 'greed for gain' type scenario, what we are creating is a Charitable Economy that provides an incentive for doing good. So many people around the globe have never experienced the feeling and reward that truly comes from helping someone in need - no amount of money can change that but until we can encourage more people to help we will keep the current system.  A Charitable Economy is a true paradigm shift and our best chance to defeat global poverty. commitgood.com",pos
"  Hello. Thank you so much for doing that. However, I will talk to Clay to fix the things very soon.",pos
I heard about Commit Good; that it is a highly transparent and trustworthy platform. It is backed by a team of highly experienced professionals as well as reputable international organizations. They also say that donations made to charity on the platform are traceable. This gives potential donors the confidence to part with their money knowing it will get to the intended charity organization. Commit Good will embark on a crowdsale by 4th July 2018 to enable investors invest in their GOOD tokens. I would love to invest in it. Can anyone vouch for their transparency? Will it be a good buy?,pos
"   Commit Good does not have a defined referral system in place. But when you perform specific transactions, you are rewarded with the GOOD tokens. You also get rewarded for making deliveries on behalf of local charities.",pos
"   Most supporters of charity are by nature philantropists. So, they are not looking for a place where they can make gains but where to give to relieve the plight of humanity. But they have to be sure that their donations are not wasted. That's where Commit Good makes the difference - ensuring that the donated moneys get to the original beneficiaries. Everything is done transparently.",pos
"   Thank you for your great questions! Firstly, the MVP for the Commit Good Ecosystem is already in development and is scheduled for release in the fourth Quarter (Q4) of 2018. Follow our channels on social media to keep in touch and get up- to- date news of events of Commit Good.  Secondly, as to the question of how end-users can make donations, the technology is fairly straight forward. All donation making and receiving happens on the Commit Good ecosystem.  1.   When an organization applies to receive donations for charity, he goes through an onboarding and verification process and when approved can create a donation order, this order is added to the order book on the blockchain via smart contract. 2.   Third party users who wish to make donations will be required to sign into the Commit Good app (via mobile or web) and make donations to charities of their choice with all information available via the donation order book. 3.   Donations are sent into the unique contract of each donation recipient and withdrawn by the donation order creator or specified contract owner.  All transactions history will be equally shared, shared with others upon approval or be made public.",pos
"This is very interesting project Beyond with a very good platform and the supply is also very good, with such a lot of people will want to join in this project later",pos
"    Commit Good looks like it is a revolutionary service built on the Blockchain. With a service like this I think more people can feel confident about giving to charities and taking part in donation programs without fear that their hard earned money will be stolen or fraudulent things. If this service becomes a success, then it will be a great thing for the crypto-world because it will have successfully solved the donation-scam problems.",pos
"Ever since I first saw the information on Commit good service, I have been looking to learn more about it. I am really interested in a service that can provide a trusted way to make donations to charity that is secure and accountable. It is past time the world had something like this. I am a little disappointed that there aren’t enough articles and content about this great service, but they are new and I am keeping my fingers crossed!",pos
"If you are searching for the safest platform on which to support your favorite charity, then Commit Good remains your best bet. On the Commit Good platform, all transactions are done transparently, thereby giving donors and recipients confidence that their moneys are safe.  Besides, Commit Good enables you to locate the nearest charity organization to you and provides a reliable platform on which to promote it to a larger international audience. That’s not all; every delivery you make on behalf of local charities is rewarded. You can even earn more money by taking part in their token distribution.",pos
"I was sick of getting cheated from different platforms until I saw this. I go throw Commit Good.  And I am really satisfied about your business structure, goal and vision. This is an innovation in the coin industry for sure. But I have a question – how do you resolve the community dispute issues? It would be really great if you clarify this issue.",pos
"  Thank you for your time. Yes, our goal is to be one of the best platform in the cryptocurrency by using GOOD TOKEN. We mostly solve the online dispute transaction and reward 3 GOOD TOKENS who helps to solve the problem. For Example:  Most bank transactions are properly made following the instructions of the account holder - and are completed successfully without any problems. However, sometimes things can go wrong. This is often because the consumer disputes having made or authorized the transaction.  Sometimes the problem is that the consumer agrees they made the transaction, but says that it was not correctly carried out or recorded. An example would be where the consumer went to make a withdrawal from a cash machine, but says the money was not dispensed by the cash machine even though it was debited to their account.",pos

"Hey there,  This is why I believe in this project, Peer to Peer, and why I believe in crypto.  I was just reading an article, its a good one, they compared ICO raising capital to current IPO and made this statement.......""So, yes it is broken. The innovation capital business does need fixing. Whether some variant of the ICO is the fix is what we now turn our attention to."".......and when I consider that statement where someone who may have knowledge of the financial industry and writes about it states it is broken, yet the regulators are more concerned with stopping something growing that is currently worth 220 billion instead of fixing something that is 200 trillion, or higher. That is 1 thousand times larger that the coin market cap, get that 1 thousand times larger.   And another article I read talked about the howey test and whether a token is a security, and part of forming an opinion about whether a token/coin is a security is making a decision surrounding 3rd involvement for the service or product to work, therefore adding value to the token/coin. The problem there of course is that everything needs some 3rd party involvement, everything has someone else involved to make it better, which means the regulators have their definitions so vague that the compliance people within the various industries and companies choose to err on the side caution when in comes to doing business.  I have seen it countless time within the financial industry when a compliance manager questions you on the way you are doing something minor and wants you to implement major changes, and all at the cost to the client. in fact the client doesn't even come into the conversation until the conversation is complete, they are never even considered during the entire process. So to conclude, why cant the current law enforcers enforce the law, if somebody is doing the wrong this it really isn't that hard to prove. David really needs the community to help this time, because its going to take more than a slingshot to bring down Goliath...  Does anyone else agree...I would love to know your thoughts!",pos

"Maybe we need to unite and be stronger. We were able to trace the details of the recent Tether fraud to where it came from. And we even worked out it was from the same person as once or even twice before.  The scammers that take money anywhere from Crypto are doing it illegally and should be prosecuted. But it seems that we say the system is not regulated so we can do whatever we like. We say it is decentralised and free from authority. So we need to discuss all this openly, but we also need stronger leaders within the community to tell the banks to politely go away. We will control this ourselves thank you very much. The banks control the markets that we in this system are opposed to, yet we are allowing them to dictate to us.  Lets rally up and REVOLT. We are gaining traction. I know you said $220 billion Andrew but I just had a quick look and the market cap has grown to $250 Billion. We are now getting stronger. Let us go to the governments and talk to them about what we are. DON'T let the banks via the regulators dictate what we are.  When Standard Chartered continually break the law by allowing money laundering and traffickers to use their services knowingly. At least 3 times they have been fined for breaching the law by far more than the market cap of Crypto. And yet we want them to control this market to. REVOLT.  I am so looking forward to helping Crypto evolve through our Peer to Peer Property platform. By getting property into the crypto markets will help get some stability to it.  ",pos
    Cheers for that. We believe in our project and are very excited about it.  We believe that getting property stronger in the Crypto Markets will help its stability.  But also we can remove a lot of unnecessary fees when it comes to property investment and development.  We have a large team to ensure we have all angles covered. With so many developments happening in this market we need to be on top of everything.  Even more we will be looking at collaborating with everyone in the real estate space to make it stronger.  Can you see Property helping the strength of Crypto?,pos
"**Property Investment**  Hi There team. As part of our Peer to Peer Property Platform we will be putting up various investing opportunities that we have. We are currently working on a deal with at least a 20% return on your investment. We will have this available to the community straight after the token sale.  Here are the quick numbers for a deal we are considering.  $75,000 Block $85,000 House $50,000 Landscaping and Marketing  That only $210,000  Houses in this area are going for around $300,000 upwards for a standard 3 bed home. So marketed correctly we can make a good amount of money through this investment. We will be looking at having this investment be turned over inside 2 months.  Now these figures are at this stage just for demonstration purposes. We will offer a much more comprehensive report on the platform to allow all token holders to evaluate the best deal for them. In this project we have targeted an area that is desperate for low cost housing. We will be putting this investment on the platform. Along with many other deals. This is just one deal in particular that we have been working on. We have also had a couple of opportunities we have put aside to focus on this project.  Does this type of property investment deal interest you? If you could put $50-$50,000 into this and get a 20-30% return in 2 months would you be willing to invest? ",irr
We are starting to really build some traction. With an investment project being prepared for when the platform is released or at least compliance attained. We might well be underway really soon. We are looking at January before the first project will be started and of course lots of compliance issues to get through. But we want to make sure that this project is really going to kick off with a bang. Come on over and check us out on Telegram. You will find all the information you need there or over at our Telegram channel. Talk soon,pos
"   Hi There HP Guy  Great question. The projects we are looking at are low cost housing type projects. House renovations. Subdivide/Split land into 2 sections. Mainly along the residential housing scale. We are concentrating on the low cost housing developments as we have found a high demand for this worldwide. However on the platform we will have whatever the community brings to the platform. Bring the deal and see if the market feels it is good for them. We are targeting fast turnarounds. The housing projects we are looking at will be finished in 2-4 months with a 20% ROI.  However with fractional ownership these parcels can be traded between parties in a Peer to Peer manner too. However once a project is underway all aspects will be secured. We are also offering a guarantee on all of the projects through the platform. This way we can ensure the parties involved always get their returns.  It could be buying and selling too. We will have a listing app available as part of the whole platform. However you will note that we have a listing app being developed in the first quarter. However, we may have something in the pipeline coming out before the end of the Token Sale. This is to try to build up traction and subscribers all the way along.  So with a lot of small projects being promoted continually it stimulates the token sales which in turn stimulates the value of the token.",pos

"   Hi thanks for your attention on that! Let me clarify that for you.  1) Why certain member's linkedin are unavailable?    ANSWER: Sorry, maybe we have mistakenly setting as private. But you have to be a linkedin members to be able to see our profiles. I'll check with Linkedin, because we are signing in perfectly?. ( Im Priscilla here by the way. hehe) Check back again in a while, should work! it has been identified with  please check it there?  2)How do you guys consider secure for your exchanges? OK, i'm going to try to explain to you a more in-depth and detailed  security features that we implement to ensure the maximum security. We are developing our exchange based on an end to end encryption ecosystem by implementing smart contracts  + 0X protocol. If you understand how smart contract that are powered by the Ethereum blockchain works; all transactions are ""ESCROWED"", smart contract will calls to functions and execute which is safe guarded;  But unfortunately, the smart contract itself is on-chain which means all transactions will need gas fees for each trades; making trading at big volume is not so realistic, where gas price will go up significantly; so we are using 0X protocol to maximize the technology, offering off-chain ordering relay to make all trades more efficiently by cutting down the gas price; and network congestion.                                                                Therefore this it is like a wallet to wallet exchange on steroid, to ensure all transaction fast, efficient and secured.  3) How do you guys plan to compete with exchanges like Binance? In my opinion, there are a lots of great exchanges out there, but we do believe exchanges should be decentralised and transparence; This might be a very sensitive issues as we see, centralised exchanges are all in CONTROLLED in favor to the exchanges themselves. Traders are usually the one that pays for the costs. Let me make it more clear, Centralised platform is making money from collecting transaction fees; which means, they are mostly in favor to the ""WHALES"", they are in controlled of the market. Look at the stock exchange market system today...Isn't this is the reason why Blockchain Technology is born? Because we want DECENTRALISED and TRANSPARENCE? We are looking to create a fair trade market. An exchange platform for the users; as we are proudly claiming; we are an OPEN digital assets exchange platform; we want to be LOW COST, almost ""FREE"" transactions for all digital assets trade. We believe many users are sick and tired of paying high fees for all transaction; which at the end of the day, the winners are the TOKEN DEVELOPER and EXCHANGES. This is not what we want!  4) How can you ensure that you will be listed on exchanges like Binance, Bittrex? Then, if you are operating a DEX, why would you want your token to be listed on other exchanges? This is a real world. We are from finance background, and we understand the markets, we understand the people. Most traders are not going to change their habits, and trade in your exchange immediately as many people are still very unfamiliar with new technology. People are afraid of change, especially in ASIA country, which explains why, even after so many incidents of centralised exchanges gets hacked; people are still trading on centralised network. And one of the downside of the current decentralised platforms are too complicated, they are hard to operate. Many users still do not understand!  We are going to list our CBX tokens into other exchanges ( eg. Binance, Bittrexx, Okcoin, etc ) because we believe there are different kinda investor crowds in cryptocurrency world; CENTRALISED VS DECENTRALISED, and we want them all. We want traders to understand that we are open and we hoping them to see the differences. It is never easy to shift a person from one to another. This has been our past experience in banking system.  As we've explain before, there are many different investors who has different believe, even the ""THE TWO BIG DIGITAL ASSETS"" ( BTC [Decentralised] VS. XRP [Centralised] ) are building for different crowds in the market. We surely want all our investors to just trade all our CBX tokens in our platform, but we understands that this is not possible. Besides that, we wishes that all our investors are staying confident with us; which sadly in this world, its how much the value you can offer to them. Shifting and educating users about a new technology takes time; and time is money. Investors today do not wait for you to be success! So, make them success, and their success would succeed your vision.   Hope that clears up your enquiries.  Chubex Team",irr

Over the past 18 months thousands of blockchain projects have been handled through Moneo. The current model of hiring individual freelancers for larger projects just doesn’t scale. Clients often don’t know what they need, managing freelance teams is onerous, time is wasted, and closed reputation systems are restrictive.  Despite this, demand for freelance talent is increasing. To properly take care of that demand, DREAM is being positioned like an accelerator. DREAM will crowdsource knowledge to scope ideas and structure projects. It will use decentralised reputation systems and AI models to build teams, providing access to a very high quality network of incubators, accelerators, and investors that is currently being built.  DREAM has built a solid team and are deeply immersed in the startup community ensuring that they develop a solution that people want and need.

"Hello everyone, DREAM's CEO Richard Foster has shared a project update. The update concerns important tasks to be taken on this week:   • DREAM plans to finish KYC documents and processes to align with the Gibraltar regulatory requirements.   • DREAM will finalise branding/positioning. When people read the whitepaper (and when we talk about the project) they get it. At the moment the landing page in the first 60 seconds isn’t clear enough. The team is lucky enough to have access to some marketers who have launched some of the worlds biggest startups to help with this.   • DREAM will then need to issue the final version of the whitepaper for legal review (later this week).   • DREAM are preparing to publish a lot more content. DREAM have hired  who has already started writing some blogs.   • DREAM are looking to push the whitelist start out to the 12th of May to deal with the compliance/regulatory requirements.   • Next week is when marketing will accelerate considerably.   ""AmaZix are doing a great job at managing day-to-day approvals in the rewards campaign, however we need to improve the overall management within DREAM, for example; management of translations, security reports, blogs, etc. We’re looking to hire someone this week to deal with that.""  So we can expect to see more content on this exciting project coming soon. Thank you all for your ongoing support.",irr

"ICO Analysis: Dream Published on April 17, 2018 By noahsayres  Verdict I am extremely impressed with Dream. Not only does their platform seem incredibly well thought out, but they have already built the foundation of it with Moneo and had immense success doing so. Although contractor marketplaces such as Upwork and Fiverr are entrenched, their core value proposition centers on the idea that contractors are willing to pay 20% of their project payments to Upwork in exchange for access to a large client base and a trusted escrow system. Yet over time, contractors find long-term clients and no longer need the security of Upwork’s platform. When that happens, they cannot take their reputation with them, locking them onto the platform. If Dream were just a marketplace that solved the reputation issue, they would already be an interesting investment. But they appear to be much more. They are a platform for the blockchain era, using the technology to maximize efficiency. By using a crypto escrow system that they themselves designe, they offer flexibility not available anywhere else. In short, Dream is a next-generation platform that matches projects with workers and continuously improves itself from studying the outcomes of these pairings.  Risks     Upwork and Fiverr have huge brand recognition and it could prove challenging to earn the trust of contractors who rely on them for their livelihoods. -3.5     Allowing reputation portability is great unless the accuracy of ratings from other platforms is low. This would then throw off the accuracy of Dream’s recommendations. -3  Growth Potential     Dream has a highly qualified team that has already built and refined the core product. +4     They solve essentially every issue that contractors have with existing centralized platforms. +3     There is an unusually low fixed token supply which means that it takes far less capital going in to raise the price. +4     Their platform will continuously refine itself thanks to AI and machine learning. +3  Disposition Dream earns a 7.5/10. Although this rating is incredibly high, I believe in this case it is justified. Everything from the token economics to the quality of the team to the product they already have running smoothly begs the question why there is not more publicity around this project. Proof: -analysis-dream/  This is very good result!",pos

"Hello Community,  Here's a quick project update for DREAM shared by our CEO Richard Foster:   • We've spent this week working on the messaging / narrative. We're updating the whitepaper and website and will push all the updates early next week. It’s really important to build a product that customers need.   • We're working through a final legal review, however we're looking good. We’ll only ramp things up when we are legally sound.   • We've just about sorted the KYC processes to align with the financial regulators in Gibraltar. We had to push out the dates which are now fixed:   > Whitelist: 26th May > Pre-Sale: 9th June → 16th June > Main-Sale: 16th June → 14th July    • We have a business development team (Vladimir is owning that) ready to kick start next week.   • We've spent a lot of time planning our marketing strategy. We're going to focus on the working with and engaging with our community. We could spend lots on paid ads and banners, but DREAM is a community project. Community engagement will be our focus.   • Our Rewards Program has already had 20k claims approved and we've done no marketing - we'll be working this channel to really work with our community.   • We have a backlog of announcements and PR, we just want to schedule things at the right time. You just wait 👍 🚀   I want to share our mission: “Bring people together. Create opportunity. Deliver success. Be open, honest, and transparent. Never compromise on quality”. This is true to our heart, and this is who we are.  We’re not some crappy token sale, the ecosystem we’re building is a new way of working. We have a live revenue generating platform, an incredible team, 12 months of work on the DREAM project, and loads of support.   I am pitching DREAM every day to VC’s and accelerators and they love it. We’re going to smash this. 👊  This time next week, the project will be going for it. Our team will be here every day and you’ll see traction.    Feedback is welcome.

Hi guys! I'm noticing a huge increase in your Dream activity on Twitter! Just wondering why there is not much info going on your facebook page though? I understand that FB is not as crypto friendly as Twitter however I think you should be getting your message out on FB too to build greater awareness and support of this project!,irr
I have to say this is a project that excites me. Been reading about it today and I think this will be a valuable addition to crypto in general. Can anyone offer their services to the talent pool? How does that work exactly ?,pos
"   Hi there, Thank you for the question.  In the traditional hiring economy such as LinkedIn or a headhunter, one would need to go through various, un-verified and inconsistent data in different formats through various channels to uncover talents.  It is a hit-and-miss process that requires a lot of valuable time to research and long, multiple interviews to find a potential candidate.  DREAM utilizes blockchain and AI technology to verify talent's credentials, store their past work history/projects, effectively matches and assembles the team, based on skills, reputation, and personal fit. DREAM specializes in offering talents who major in Blockchain related industry, but talents from other industries are also welcome to be verified and listed to offer their services in DREAM.  In addition, DREAM also provide unique features such using AI to building the structure of one's new project, utilize the tried and true knowledge that was learned from previous success projects and make that info available to the new clients.   The Whitepaper will help you understand DREAM better ;-)  Let us know if there's anything else you need? thanks!",irr

"""ERC725 is a proxy smart contract, which allows it to be controlled by multiple keys and other smart contracts. It serves as a basis for an identity of any kind. I had the idea two years ago and had expected others to come up with a standard – But nobody did, so I felt the urge to create one.  I realized that ERC725 is only a full identity solution when used in combination with ERC735, as this standard allows attaching claims to a proxy smart contract. This way, you have provable owners who can control the identity and the added claims by the others who are validating that particular identity.""

"Project success hinges on the team, yet pulling the right one together is tough. DREAM learns from the outcomes of past blockchain projects to build freelance teams with the right skills and fit.  “Essential to the success of any startup is the team. With a shortage of blockchain talent, and increasing blockchain projects in our portfolio we see DREAM as an ideal solution. DREAM are already part of the broader SOSV ecosystem, underpinning our belief.” said Ryan Shuken, Program Director at MOX. ",pos
"Can you briefly explain the role of the DREAM token in the ecosystem? How will the token be held, in what wallet, how will it be awarded?  A: We published our Token Mechanics here. We address a fundamental problem with AI, which is data classification. There is no way we could model past project outcomes without customer insights, and we achieve that by paying through our tokens.  DREAM Token is a payments token backed by smart contracts used to pay for freelancers, gigs, and premium services. We will also charge for API access for insights into our data sets.  We’ve already proven through DREAM Rewards that tokens are a powerful marketing tool and have had 50,000 claims so far. We will continue DREAM Rewards as an off-platform customer acquisition channel.  At the moment the only incentive to achieve profile completion on DREAM is to get listed on our website. Part of our customer acquisition costs will be paid through DREAM Tokens to push users further down the funnel.    Read more: https://[Suspicious link removed]/dH395VE",irr

"ICO Analysis: Dream Published on August 30, 2018 By Daniel Won Proof: -analysis-dream-2/  Team CEO and co-founder Richard Foster: Foster was a network architect at BP, BNY Mellon, and QBE Insurance. CFO and co-founder Amy Diez: Diez held several positions at KPMG, a well-known accounting firm, for more than 10 years.  Advisors Bertrand Theaud: Theaud is a former managing partner at Winston & Strawn LLP and a partner at DLA Piper. He is a blockchain legal expert. Adam Dossa: Before becoming the director of technology at Polymath, Dossa worked in several positions at Morgan Stanley for thirteen years.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Dream.  Risks     Blockchain freelancing platforms do not tend to do well. (-1)     Competition with huge freelancing companies such as Upwork and Fiverr. (-2)     Adoption, both from and out of the crypto-verse, will be a challenge. (-1.5)  Growth Potential     Dream provides almost all features big freelancing platforms do. (+1.5)     Not all freelancer applications are accepted, so only the best ones are admitted. This ensures that any work is completed with high quality. (+2)     Dream AI might turn out to be a revolutionary tool for freelancing platforms. (+3.5)     Tools provided to manage group projects and “project history” feature are definitely neat and much needed. (+2)  Disposition Dream is a blockchain freelancing platform supported by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Although competition with already existing platforms will be hard, the existence of Dream AI is definitely promising for the project and it can make Dream the first blockchain freelancing platform with significant success. Dream receives a 4.5/10.",irr

"Bounty open: The 28th of March 2018 at 4pm UTC will mark the start of the dueltoken.io ICO. We have prepared and thoroughly tested the ICO smart contract, and now we want to submit it to our community for review.  Key elements of the ICO:  The ICO is divided in 3 phases, with bonuses in earlier phases. The ICO starts with a first period of 24 hours limited to whitelisted members. The second and third phases are open to all. The contract allows for a refund of ETH if the soft cap is not met. Tokens can only be traded after the trade switch is called by the owner The token model is as following:   Open-source development and transparency are crucial when building healthy ecosystems – which is the intent of dueltoken.io. We would like your help to review the ICO contract through the following bounty.  ICO Review Bounty  Bugs can’t be reported twice, the first person to report it in here or on our GitHub will receive the bounty. Contract source:   20,000 DUEL tokens for bugs that will cause funds to be lost or locked so they can’t be recovered anymore, e.g. no refunds are possible when softcap isn’t reached after the ICO. 10,000 DUEL tokens for bugs that will disrupt the intended flow of the ICO or its outcome, e.g. you can buy tokens at full bonus price throughout the entire ICO. 2,000 DUEL tokens for bugs that bugs with low impact, e.g. view functions are displaying wrong data but do not impact intended behavior. The bounty closes the 21st of March at 5 PM UTC.  Feel free to contact us on our social media accounts or here in the comments.  Website:   Discord:   Twitter:   Reddit:   Github: ",irr
"A few announcements  It’s been around 2 weeks since we announced dueltoken.io and went live with the website. We had some expectations when we first started thinking of launching our project. Today we wanted to share with you what we have learned so far, and how we intend to go forward.  Building community engagement We are still really excited to bring the concept of dueltoken.io alive. It is a relevant need in the evolution of gaming and a strong use case for decentralization. In the end of 2017 — early 2018, we witnessed a strong influx of user interest in upcoming DApps. We were picturing a similar rapid and massive interest from the community as we are targeting the gaming community: a growing and digitally-native segment who embraces new technologies. We chose not to create social bounties as user engagement is far more valuable to us than a large number of inactive followers.  A working product So far, we have elaborated a product vision, both from a business and a technical point of view. We have also prepared some high-level wireframes to give you an idea of the experience we intend to put into place.  Now our focus will be directed towards developing a minimum viable product (preferably a minimum lovable product). In the same way as we intend to build dueltoken.io in the foreseeable future, we want this to be a collaborative effort. We will conduct a user story mapping session with the team, publish it online and integrate your feedback. You will help us decide which features should be part of the MVP. We believe that this is the correct approach to get you excited about dueltoken.io and excited about the future of the ecosystem — thus grow an engaged community.  Timeline For the time being, we are putting a pause button on the ICO. When the timing is right, when we’ve produced a working MVP and that we have started to build an engaged community, we will propose a new date for the crowdsale. For now, we will focus our time and energy on building the foundations to make this community grow.",irr
"Eternal Trusts is a blockchain platform for deferred purchases of future technologies  Eternal Trusts is a platform designed to automatize the purchase of services that cannot be provided today due to various reasons such as ethics, legislation, lack of scientific knowledge etc.  We act in the interests of our clients, introducing special-purpose discretionary trusts that are legal constructs, protecting our clients’ assets from any third-party actions. These trusts may be allocated only to satisfy the client’s wishes and needs. Our trusts can exist for hundreds of years, all the time trying to find opportunities to meet the client’s demand.  The assets in the trusts are put in the most reliable banks under the most reliable long-term strategies. Our mission is to ensure that there is enough money in the trust to accomplish the purchase of a service for our client when it becomes possible. Trust management is provided until the service ordered by the client becomes possible to purchase. Then the deal is settled.  The trust, represented by Eternal Trusts, cannot avoid fulfilling its responsibilities because they are registered on the blockchain and automatized for completion. An autonomous goal-accomplishing algorithm analyses potential contractors annually. If they meet the necessary reliability criteria, then we purchase the services for our client.   ",irr

"Well, what is a trust? A trust is actually a kind of legal relations between two parties or more. These are the owner (settlor of a trust), who transfers their property or funds to the trustee under trust managing conditions. The trustee is recognized then as the owner of the transferred property or funds, but manages it only to fulfill the trust purpose or for the benefit of the third-party person who is the trust beneficiary. Also, there could be Enforcers and Protectors who oversee the actions of the trustee, so that they fully correspond with the initial goals of the settlor.  A trust is a perfect opportunity to protect one’s assets and to make a ‘smart’ last will instead of a traditional one with a limited range of management opportunities.  The discretionary trust is secure because the settlor cannot be deprived of their property for they settle it on the trust fully and forfeit all the rights to it. Large powers in managing the settlor’s property are vested to the trustee. Still, the trustee has no right to make use of the property they manage in order to pay their own personal debts or to skip from executing the trust purpose.  ",neg

But sooner or later they will be available to a wide range of users and the only question is whether you can buy them. With Eternal Trusts you can do it.

Is this not the eternal life that mankind has long dreamed of? By creating a trust on our platform you can get a unique opportunity to continue your existence in the future.  ",irr
    Do you have a question about the bounty program? Please specify what you mean. Thank you,irr
"The technology of cryopreservation of biological material originated in the 50s of the XX century. In fact, it was then that scientists first proposed to a mankind a way of preserving living cells for many years, and the development of controlled cooling technologies that have been successfully used to store blood, seed, eggs and other biomaterials for several decades, has brought these technologies to a new level.  Nowadays, with the development of cryoprotective techniques instant freezing has become almost safe for biomaterials- cells do not get damaged and can be stored in a dormant state for many years... However! Let's think about why this technology has not received due popularity and distribution. Perhaps because the scientists are concentrated on freezing and not unfreezing of customers?  Let's say, you've preserved a drop of your blood or some other biomaterial, and then what? In fact, a complete mystery. Who, when and under what circumstances will unfreeze you? Whether this was the same company that was responsible for the preservation of biological material, or other? Who will make the decision about your unfreezing? Who will control the process? What guarantees do you get? Who's gonna pay for this? In what circumstances will you be restored? Will you be a full member of the society?  Offering ""eternal life"", the company promises its customers the prolongation of life using replacement organs, or the transfer of human consciousness to another substrate by chemical preservation of the brain, scanning and emulation of consciousness on a particular computing platform (in simple language, the uploading of your consciousness retains all memories and personality into a super-computer), but company doesn't say a word who will implement this process in the future and at whose expense... And without the defrost, does it make sense to make cryopreservation? The answer is obvious.  The project Eternal Trusts provides for the ""unfreezing"" of its customers – we are creating a system in which smart contracts will control the fulfillment of a contract, signed on our platform. And the subject of the transaction will be the restoration of the client, and not just the storage of the biomaterial indefinitely.  ",irr
"Eternal Trusts is highly valued by authoritative rating Agency  A number of reputable rating agencies in the field of blockchain startups assigned maximum ratings to Eternal Trusts project.

"Yesterday we already touched upon the question of who will be there to ensure the client is woken up from cryosleep and we realized there is virtually nobody to sustain the client’s biomaterial if it’s not the Eternal Trusts project…  Today let’s dream, imagine, that a thousand years has passed and for some reason the operator company (or someone else) decided to wake up a XXI century citizen from cryosleep… What’s next?  What follows may remind you of Futurama… This modern classic by 20th Century Fox is set in New New York of the XXXI century. It’s protagonist is a pizza delivery guy called Philip J. Fry, who found himself penniless and without friends or family in a completely new world. Would you like to find yourself in the same situation? Something tells us the answer is a resounding no. A high tech future where you don’t have a home, money, any knowledge of the legal system or even how to use all these modern gadgets does not look so bright.  This situation is bound to change with the advent of the Eternal Trusts platform where the clients of today get to meet the contractors of tomorrow. You can set any objective by ordering services that are not yet available today, and as soon as a suitable contractor for the objective appears, the deal is sealed.  Want to live in the future and get education as well? Simply set this objective on the platform and it will be fulfilled. Want to buy revivification treatments? The platform will find you a suitable contractor. Dreaming of an interplanetary trip? Simple! Or maybe you want to share this amazing future with your significant other, and that’s possible too!  You can order anything you can think of! Simply set the objectives on our platform, making it a product that you are seeking to buy, and we’ll find you a seller! Write down every element of your dream on our platform and we’ll make sure the deals are done wherever they become available, legal and ethically acceptable.  ",irr

"When you input a dream into Eternal Trusts, you can be sure – it will be fulfilled! Why? Because we don’t have any other choice but to fulfill your wish, and it’s built into the very mechanism of trusts. Let’s try and make sense of how it all works!  So, by inputting on the blockchain an objective that is not yet possible or achievable at this time, the client supplies his input with a number of additional goals, which in turn allows to set priorities.  So, it’s always good to enter the top priority objective first, for example within 200 years try to revive you with your consciousness and memories intact using stored genetic material and then transfer your funds multiplied after all this time.  You can supplement the objective with additional ones: help with education (so you don’t end up feeling like a caveman after 200 years of technology has gone by), fix health issues (or rectify as many deviations from the generally acceptable norm as possible), help with legal issues (documents and ID). One more possible additional objective: the platform can only activate the sequence of purchases if the client’s purchasing power matches the average of the top 1% (2-3-5%, you name it) of the population at the time of check.  You can also set a so-called realistic target – in case 200 years is not enough to complete the priority objective for any reason. In some cases case it may sound like this: transfer the biomaterial for cloning and pass all the assets to my genetic copy, help with education, health and legal issues.  And if by the end of the period none of the above is possible, you can obligate the trustee to pass the multiplied assets to your closest genetic relatives, and if there aren’t any, spend the money on charity.  Thus the trustee has a precise wish from the client on what to do, which means the Eternal Trusts project infrastructure will ensure every dream is fulfilled if it’s technologically possible within the client’s preset timeframe.  ",pos
"We could became an early bird for the bounty campaign of this project, since the starting date for the pre-ico still in the next few moments . That would be a good chance to get more stakes fro the bounty.",pos
"The idea of the research groups are unique, because they analyze the potential demand for their latest developments and the customer's unique product to create smart contracts and infrastructure that will ensure autonomous purchasing of future services.",pos

"Smart Contracts Serve as base for Eternal Trusts Platform  If you’re interested in cryptocurrencies or blockchain, you might have heard the term “smart contract”. Let us speak about it a little.  So, a smart contract is a digital algorithm or a set of conditions that, upon triggering, allow parties to exchange funds, shares or other assets. Usually this financial instrument is cryptocurrencies.  How does it work? Here’s an example.  Have you ever bought real estate? If the answer is yes, you probably know that you need a notary officer to make the transaction, and that means additional charges for the buyer. Smart contracts allow to forego the services of middlemen such as banks, lawyers, notary officers etc. since the contract checks the contractual obligations by itself before verifying it. An asset or a currency is then entered into the program. After that the contract fulfilment is supervised by the program. As soon as the conditions are fulfilled, the parties exchange assets. The seller receives a specific sum of money while the buyer receives the good. In other words, everything is done automatically.    It is Ethereum smart contracts that became the base for the Eternal Trusts platform. Upon creating a trust we generate a smart contract with your objective or dream in it and as soon as it becomes available, the deal executes automatically! This removes the so-called human element, and smart contracts can exist for indefinite periods of time. Along with them the system will also live on and patiently wait for you until all the conditions fall into place and allow the deal to be executed, fulfilling your dream.  ",pos
"Do you know that in 1626 the Indians sold Manhattan island for $ 30?  This deal is considered to be one of the worst in history, but is it like that?  It can be calculated that if this money had been placed on the current account at the annual rate of 10%, the cost of the capital this year would be 504 quadrillion (504 723 861 114 838 000) US dollars…  Why did we come up with this example? To say, that while creating a trust you do not just put money in a safe, but you guarantee long term asset management of those assets. The company is interested in the fact that the amount in your account is constantly growing (it takes a percentage as a management fee), which means that the money is not depreciate. Thus, the purchase of virtually any goal that you have programmed with Eternal Trusts, is possible and achievable if there is a suitable contractor found while the Trust is operational.  ",pos

"What is the Eternal Trusts token?  The main purpose of the token is to serve as fuel that powers every stage of the Dream Execution Flow. First, you can become a client and initiate the long-term process only by purchasing the ET tokens. At every stage of the dream execution, all classes of oracles that provide their input to the platform will receive rewards also in the form of Eternal Trusts tokens. In addition, all service transactions with providers will be token-based. Thus, we make sure that the token is an essential part of our business model and operations, and is closely tied to our value proposition.  Essentially, Eternal Trusts is a DAO that consists of a group of blockchain addresses with different ET token balances. The rights of the DAO participants are determined by the amount of Eternal Trusts tokens in possession, so the more tokens you own, the more rights you have to cast votes and offer proposals. Hence, on a more global level, holding a large amount of tokens can even authorize you to participate in important strategic decisions about ecosystem development, internal policies and configurations, as well as decisions to integrate third-party platforms through API.   The smart contract ecosystem of Eternal Trusts will also allow providers to start crowdfunding token-based campaigns for sponsoring research & development that would create components for clients purposes. We aggregate the demand by “tokenizing” it on the platform, thereby helping the scientific community steer their research towards fields most essential to humanity. One of the crowdfunding models that we envision is letting R&D labs and companies conduct their own ICOs on our own platform with the use of ET tokens, which would allow them to raise necessary funding to support their research in the long-term. Those projects brought to reality via the Eternal Trusts platform will also be encouraged to use ET tokens as their currency.  Overall, we aim to create a balanced and robust transactional system by taking market prices, costs, and volume of transactions into account. The DAO will be able to configure the system in a way that will ensure the token will be in high demand by both clients and providers of innovative services.",irr

"We at Eternal Trusts believe that science is the most powerful force to do good for humanity  More experts are inclined to think of the human brain as a biological “computer” that stores all information about a person, including memory and personality. Due to outstanding scientific progress of the recent years, it seems more plausible now than ever that it will be possible to safely preserve the brain for long periods of time and bring it back to life in the future, either in its biological form or by transferring the information that it contains to another computational “substrate”. If this mindset is shared by more researchers, companies, and the society in general, then it becomes much more likely that the needed technologies will arrive soon to allow people to escape death, making it only a pause in their indefinitely long lives.  To accelerate this process, Eternal Trusts are building a platform that would enable autonomous selection and purchasing of vital biomedical technologies that are expected to appear in the future. Just imagine a world where the dream of life extension can become an achievable reality for the generations living today!  Through smart contracts, AI, and reliable legal structures called purpose trusts, we guarantee that as soon as a necessary technology required by our clients appears on the market, all transactions, which ensure the technology is delivered, will be made automatically. As part of the process, we look for providers that preserve and store our clients’ brains and bodies. So, if the clients’ goals of life extension are not achievable in their lifetime, if and when the scientific progress will advance enough, they will be brought back to life from the preserved biomaterial. As we manage the assets of our clients in the purpose trusts, we seek to grow their value, which ensures that there is enough funds when it is due to purchase necessary procedures. Decentralization, selection of the best biotech providers, and asset management are some of the very important features of the platform that provide a high probability of successful life extension, higher than the more basic models used today by cryopreservation companies.  In principle, Eternal Trusts is not limited to procedures with biomaterials and can guarantee the acquisition of any high-tech service as soon as it becomes ethical, legal and available in the market. By aggregating demand, the platform provides scientists with valuable data to analyze when determining the direction of R&D and looking for external investments. Hence, by contributing to Eternal Trusts, you have the power to directly influence the future.  For more details about the project please visit our website: ",irr

"The Tokenomics of Eternal Trusts  Many of those who have already bought the Eternal Trusts tokens are asking us about the basic factors that will influence and sustain its value during the growth of our platform. First and foremost, ETT is a based on the ERC-20 protocol, which is deemed the standard in the industry of smart contracts. Our token is highly multipurpose and is closely tied to our unique value proposition, as well as to every aspect of our business model. It is a utility token needed for all components of the Purpose Execution Flow and its value depends primarily on important platform KPIs and product metrics.  The Eternal Trusts Token is a service token needed for launching the Purpose Execution Flow. It’s also a reward token for the Oracles of Eternal Trusts. To increase the value of the token, Oracles have to hold a share of 10% (or other value defined by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization) of ET Tokens from each reward. The growth of the clients base is the primary foundation of the proportional demand growth of the token and its fundamental value.   All service providers have to hold a share of 10% (or other value defined by DAO) of tokens to retain their rights within the ET Ecosystem and participate in the processes of the Purpose Execution Flow. The growth of the providers base is also a positive factor of proportional demand growth in demand as well as the token value.   As a crowdfunding platform for R&D missions demanded by the clients, we plan to attract 20% (or other value defined by DAO) more crowdfunded projects than previous year. This KPI will produce a gradually increasing shift between the demand for ETT tokens from crowd-investors and its supply for funded R&D-organisations.   All ETT token holders can become participants of the ET DAO. The rights of the DAO participants are determined by the amount of Eternal Trusts tokens that they hold. There are several levels of rights for DAO participants that depend on their balance: the right to cast a vote (1st level), the right to issue proposals for determining rules of the Purpose Execution Flow (2d level), the right to offer proposals and initiate voting to change the structure and parameters of the whole DAO (3d level).  Knowing more about the fundamentals of our tokenomics, consider buying our token now on a very favorable set of conditions: ✔️ 1 ETT token price = 0.1 USD ✔️ Now you can buy tokens with a maximum discount — 50% ✔️ Minimum purchase is 10000 ETT Tokens ✔️ Tokens for sale: 200,000,000 ETT  Do not forget that the earliest investors will get the most favorable token price!  👉We are waiting for you on our website ",irr

The amount of valuable feedback that we received talking to potential partners and customers was astonishing, and we keep aggregating and analyzing it to make further strategic decisions.

We want to make sure that those parts, combined with our innovative technological solution, form a robust system capable of providing value from the get-go.  There are many exciting things coming up. During the token sale, there will be a major overhaul of our marketing strategy, with a strong focus on building and promoting a product that can be useful at this instant. I think we succeeded in getting everyone enthusiastic about the wide range of possible applications of Eternal Trusts. Now it is time for us to focus on bringing real value to the token holders and the customers and to prove we can make Eternal Trusts a reality. In the coming days, we are going to initiate a global blockchain hackathon with many captivating development challenges based on Hyperledger, NEO, and Ethereum.

"Did you know Eternal Trusts provides a mechanism that guarantees execution of your bravest and most fantastic dreams and wishes. ET can also support you in more tangible matters and guarantee execution of real objectives in the near future. Today we would like to present you education trusts by ET.  We understand the special importance of quality education in the 21st century lots of parents dream of giving their children better education opportunities, however, few can afford that kind of luxury. To solve this issue there are education trusts – special funds providing a complete solution for financing your child’s education and finding the best service package for minimum price.  As you already know, a trust is a legal agreement through which one party holds the right to manage some assets for the benefit of a third party. A trust can be created for any period of time and it must have a certain purpose that when met, terminates the trust created for it. These characteristics make trusts optimal for solving the issue of long-term financing of child’s education. Such trust is considered a purpose trust and is created to provide education for a certain student. This is convenient because everyday situations don’t change the fact that the funds can only be allocated towards the needs of the beneficiary and not towards other needs. They also can’t be seized by creditors, etc.  The smart-contract-based technological solution by ET that is time-tested will only become more reliable over time. ET can monitor the quality of services in choosing, managing and organising an education program using the funds in the education trust. ET guarantees the designated use of funds and provides an optimal solution. The services covered in a trust can include: tuition, study allowance, living expenses in the country of study and transportation expenses.  Education Trusts – is a very popular service that stands improved in our project with more transparency thanks to blockchain technology and the expertise of our analysts.",irr

The first landing page will be dedicated to our product – on one page we have gathered all the main information so it is more convenient for you in learning about our mission, why we are confident in the success of this project and read more about our product to find out how we are making dreams possible to accomplish even hundreds of years into the future as well as get acquainted with the team. Here you will be able to see the video and find out how Eternal Trusts work, what is made possible due to decentralization and how to become our investor. Here ia it:    The second landing page is dedicated to ET tokens and the token sale campaign of our project. Here you will be able to find out everything about using our tokens, their price and total supply. Also, here the ICO will be detailed in stages with bonuses and special offers. On this website you will be able to learn how to become a client of Eternal Trusts and join our project. Here ia it:    Today Eternal Trusts makes a bold step towards a high-tech future and new opportunities!",irr
We have updated our website design!  Dear subscribers – we have great news! As you know – we have updated the design of our website and launched two new landing pages! We want to direct your attention to the fact that ET token holders as well as those who are just joining our project can log in on  by hitting LOG IN / SIGN UP in the upper-right corner and entering their login credentials!,irr

viewed from the incessant promotion of this project I am confident that the projects will get a lot of investors who join this project so that future projects will manage to reach the target.,pos
ICO Time: 52 days 6 hours left,irr
ETT has very good and organized team which makes its project a very promising one,pos
"Interesting indeed because this one project will provide an increase in allocation for the bounty to 4%, it is very promising if so, well the spirit that has joined and for those who have not joined let's join as soon as possible, and for those who want to join there is still a lot of time and time It's still a long time ago, hopefully it can reach hardcap later",pos

"  if that not reach they will doing an options, maybe like a vote  This is quote from one of admin on their telegram group  Quote In such a case we will show all available options and will make a vote as to what is better for the community  As i'm one of investor in Eternal Trusts i'm sure that will be reach the softcap in the last week. Yeah just hoping",pos
"If you guys looking for the latest update from Eternaltrust I will requote from their official channel, that pretty interesting to read  @EternalTrusts/development-blog-5-2-eternal-trusts-dapp-prototype-oracles-366955191995  at moment Eternal Trusts still not reach the softcap. but still have a few weeks left",irr
Strong team but addition of Blockchain developers will make stronger and white-paper. MVP looks great,pos
"  but unfortunately they are still not reach the soft cap, a few day left hope it will reach the softcap, but a good point i see, they are have a options for community, hope the options will give a great for further",pos
"  We have to remain optimistic that the target will definitely be accomplished, and perhaps because now more and more projects are popping up so as to make competition is becoming increasingly intense, and also see the marekt condition has not been stable. so make investors less interest to buy a coin. so I think the team there should be a strategy that is more attractive again to be able to keep making investors believe with this project.",pos
Eternal Trusts (ETT) is already rated by Cryptolaboratory. All facts are here. Don't miss it!,pos
"  I don't know about this either, so we look forward to hearing from the team whether the sales will continue to stop or continue, the most important thing is we just hope that the team will always do their best for this project so that what they hope can be achieved with satisfactory results and the project can develop wider for its future.",pos

It's been months since the team decided that token sale will be commenced later. Any news? and i think the market situation is now better and team can consider about starting the new ICO or IEO.,pos
"Your ICO, Eternal Trusts, has been featured in our latest article, you can read about it here: -into-5-icos-of-2019/",irr
Yes I noticed this exchange is up and running although there is no liquidity/volume there but hopefully there will be some update here from one of the devs.We live in hope so we do not die in despair,neu

"I can't find any page where I could check how much funds has been collected already? I want to see the real potentials of this project and decide If I invest or not. If there is no page for this, I'd appreciate If you could simply tell us how much raised so far (approximately)",neu
"Ah, thanks, Lauda. On my mobile screen (using firefox) the page is shifted to the left because of the media player. That crops the left part of the countdown.",neu
No one could predict the final balance its a crowdsale after all.,neu
"I like the idea, but I'm still undecided.  How is the validator going to work exactly?  People want the safety of decentralized exchanges with the speed and functionality of a centralized exchange. How will the validator provide good service and order processing?  How will it deal with large volumes and high speed trading and APIs... I'm also assuming it will all be open source.  How will bugs/problems be dealt with?  Will there be a fund for compensating errors, etc?  How do you ensure errors and bugs are minimized?  Do either of you have any development experience building an exchange engine/software?  This is a hard project, I need some reassure this won't be another failed attempt at a DEX.",neu
"   As far as I know, there is no social media campaign for NVO as of now. Just wait for further announcement if ever they will launch social media campaigns.",neu
"I think the team should have handled the ICO launch far better than this, I have invested into alot of project by just going to the website, opening account and sent fund directly to the assigned address. I will sit on the fence until the end",neu
"this project stands and falls with good tech, (that you seem to have) buy also solid UI please dont make the same mistake like poswallet.com and underrate the importance of a good clean ui design, also a decent amount of the investment has to go into this",neu
"   Regardless of what happens in the signature campaign, we support you guys at this moment. It is really sad to see this happening, we are experiencing many shut downs and lags in most of the BTC exchanges and betting sites because of this pump. Dumping now.",neu
"  Well, it would great if NVO would offer lower fees at the beginning. Make it a welcoming promo feature and lower the fees to 0.1% or even less if possible. New experimental exchanges can struggle to capture attention, we don't want to NVO to be another Bitsquare which is known as a service neglected by the users.",neu
"It looks like there’s a bunch of people that are interested in this Crowdsale since there’s a bunch of known people doing the Escrow for it. Personally, I won’t invest any money in this project unless I notice any new features released to the public.

"   bla  you need about 250 days of work for the licence, what i heard, its all about costs and the quality of your product, at the end.",neu
"   npx is on idex, a decentralised platform, with better system but not a 5-stars-infrastructure. you cant make anything wrong.  https://idex.market/eth/npx  npx back on https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/napoleonx/   ",irr
NPX needs a licence for any asset management and they wont risk our token on low volume with no licence for our future product (DAF),neu
"   Do you mean rounded down ? ya 1% a day is the golden goose, but its unrealistic imo. I dont think NapoleonX promised 1% a day anywhere, its just us investors trying to speculate how the algorithm will perform",neu
"   Strongly I doubt that even the algorithm will be able to find the highest peak. It's very difficult to get into. But the algorithm is free of human emotions, and will buy and sell at the best possible time, calculated mathematically.",neu
5% is a dream! I will settle for 1 % but I think even that is a bit of high expectation.. We will see,neg
"I also think that the benefit from daf will be huge, but 1% per day is hard to reach. Maybe it’s possible but I think daf will make a bit less % per day. But I really trust in daf and the bot behind each daf, I think that NapoleonX will be very profitable for users and investors.",neu
"   that's good right now, but I'm waiting to see how they do in practice.",neu
"I’m absolutely convinced that NaPoleonX is a great project. But, I wonder if the bots have errors leading to losses, who will be responsible for the profits of investors? ",neu
"   You might be on something here. Someone who is always active in crypto will get bored soon if there is not much activity and might decide to invest in any ICO. One thing is certain, we have some turbulent weeks incoming.",neu
"   did you talk about intraday trading or not? maybe, bots can be configure for long or short time trading",neu
I am gonna do due dilligence in this project.,pos
"  I'll see what interest investors will have on ICO, if it's good to buy, then it's worth investing in the project right away.",neu
"   Well, even as a trader I'm not sure about it right now.  I'll try with a very small port of my portfolio.",neu
Well there is a demo website available but the trading system is not yet in place (the last time I looked anyway). I hope they incorporate this in the very near future so we can have an idea on how it will perform.,neu
Its an interesting presentation but we all know its just theoretical. Unfortunately theory doesnt always work in trading so we will have to wait for an actual results of their bots after the full version.,neu
"   I've tried opening the beta amazon instance, however it's not working for me right now. Thank you for the black paper, will have a look and report back on my findings.",neu
"   Actually the ico was moved to mid november, you can see it from the website",neu
On which exchanges will you list your tokens?,neu
"No, ICO will be probably in the beginning of Novebmer. But they didnt announce exact date as I know.",neu
i think video should be create for how to use plateform and information how to use token. this is best for users.,neu
"  Just some advices. You have to choose a more important project for yourself, make a priority. Dont try to follow all projects, escpecially if youre investors.",neu
I would really appreciate if they showed more info on the arbitrage system.,neu
"   I think they should especially try to explain the whole concept of the DAFs and that there will be more ICOs, a new one for each DAF. I wouldn't say from me that I know exactly how everything will work but from my perspective it seems like some still don't know that there will be more ICOs from Napoleonx to collect the money the bots trade with.",neu
"   So we need a youtube video with lots of sounds, images, fast pace ad catchy to explain the NapoleonX Algorithm",neu
"  I think it takes a little time, when there will be an official announcement of alpha. In addition, to know the effectiveness of this bot, need lot of test. so it remains to wait",neu
is there any BOT trading efficiency data available even for alpha version? i know still there is lots of work/improvement might not complete but just wondering.,neu
"Reading back the last pages I think NaPoleonX should really make a super simple brochure that explains the idea without the technobabble. Maybe risking it loses some of its mystery, but now a lot of people have barely an idea what they are investing in.",neu
"   Probably Us citizens won't participate ico because of that. But it is their loss.  Of course, it is not a good thing for developers. They can't get funded from Us which is a big market.  But still, if I make an assessment so far, I can say they will fund get funding more than enough.",neu
"  yes dev give us a lot of informations,interviews,photos,videos all is possible to share with us,we are curious...",neu
One could argue that some regulation would make the entire bc ecosystem more solid and long term lasting. I have not entirely made up my Point on that subject yet. I can see both pros and cons with it.,neu
"  It's too early to say if it's the best, time will show us, but the project is really needed for the market and its advantage is that it supports both physical currencies and digital.",neu
"   They do have a very innovative system, but there is definitely competition from a lot of similar projects. Only time will tell who does best, but being mentioned in Forbes is already a sign that this is a very serious project.",neu
NPX voters and Strategy Managers get paid in DAF tokens once a month. But what happens with the equivalent amount of ETH and the underlying assets (eg. Future contracts) in the meantime?,neu
It's true that napoleon should show us some sneak peak of this platform. I'm really hoping to see MVP before end of ico,neu
"  That thought is not far from reality, sometimes history repeats and it can happened even on this wonderful project.",neu
"    I wonder ... and about when will announce the new terms? Partnership, the contract is of course very good, but when the previously designated dates change, this is somewhat unexpected.",neu
Well does each person individually use the bot? Or does the Napoleon team run their bots and all the token holders get a % of the earnings from these?,neu
A vid might suffice but ideally we would rather have a hand own test of a few of the arbitrage offers before the ico.,neu
I too would want to see it on the Github. It would be great if we can review the codes and check out the features clearly.,neu
"  Because so said the devs, coins with a small cap aren't suitable for trading bots, there are big risks and there are no volumes of trades.",neu
"  me too a beta-version/demo to try will be very welcome,and i think will help us all to understand better the project...",neu
"Speaking of demos, will there also be a demo mode in the final platform to develop strategies in and test trading?",neu
"waiting to see a demo, beta or just prototype is good enough for me before join this ICO",neu
"   I have used Gunbot favorably, but again you have to know what you doing to use it efficiently. Anyway, my interest is piqued to try out the bot once a demo is released. Hopefully, they sticlk with the plan and release one prior to ICO. My decision to invest will be based on favorable experience with the demo. Am tired of blindly investing in company's promises.",neu
"   Well, if the developers have made such an algorithm, then they know better how to correctly. I just made assumptions. I am satisfied with this project any trading strategy that brings profit. Since in any case, do not have to do anything, but only to make a profit. At least, so it was stated by the developers.",neu
I am pretty sure that APIs on crypto are too slow for real HFT. Someone please correct me on this if i am misinformed. But maybe in the future... i can't see a reason why not..,neu
If you set a limit per day/week you might miss the most profitable moments to make a trade but on the other hand it can be the other way around. I hope you will be able to choose between high risk high reward and low risk low reward.,neu
"  Napoleon bots should be more accurate in terms of timing local bottoms/tops. Anyway I'm sure that they will be able to support HFT, maybe not now, but definitely in the future",neu
"   Deal once a week? It's a robot. High-frequency trade. Why do I need an algorithm, once a week and I can make a deal. However, I believe that the bot will have different strategies for trading. Although in order to use the algorithm to maximize, I would prefer high speed. But the developers know better, I rely on their professionalism. Investors do not need to do anything, only to make a profit.",neu
25K ETH is a lot. We see other big projects not getting their minimum cap lately. It's more than 7.5 Million $. I hope the cap will be reached though.,neu
"I heard a lot of good reviews about this project, but I do not fully understand why and why it is needed. Can you explain it in plain language?",neu
"  Yep, reading white papers can be boring but bear in mind that every serious investor should do this. Probably the most important thing to do before investing is to make your own due diligence",neu
they have video of prototype? or demo version? i want to see and trying or understand how it all working,neu
The minimum investment is 0.01 ETH (1 NPX) for pre-sale and ICO.,neu
"   There is a risk of showing things too early. But I think in the current ICO climate, especially after those ICOs without any product raising triple digit million dollars, all demos and prototypes are welcomed as opposed to trying to sell abstract ideas and whitepapers.",neu
Showing a working demo will help very much...,neu
Can you tell me a bit about the average returns on those bots?,neu
"   I watch the video showing a little bit of how is the beta, and I hope there is a tutorial on how to set up the DAFs and all the information for the common user to start using the platform properly, I understood little of was going on in the video, I hope we will learn soon enough though.",neu
Is there any extra relevant information that could be useful related to this project?,neu
"   Let's hope so, and yes, i noticed that the team and recognizes the experience it has, you have a good reason to believe in this. I am just skeptical with a hint of optimism.",neu
"  I agree, i believe it when i see it, most bots what i have encountered, fail in long term trading, they might make some ping pong strategies work at the beginning but they don't handle trend chances in long term very well. I invested in this because if this works, roi will be insane. And hopefully it does, fingers crossed",neu
"  OK, first i would need to see this bot in action. One thing is to invest in this project and hope its value will go up, but another thing is to use extra founds and let it be traded by this bot. I will be glad to use it after i see some results.",neu
But I still wonder something. Trade is a win-lose game. not win-win. When we get money from buy low sell high someone will lost their money.,neu
"   I'm also interested in this, but it's kinda hard for a trading bot. They already have some statistics of previous trades that look promising, but i know some similar ICO's offer a glimpse into a read-only API so some trades can be noted.",neu
"   Even though i like the ICO, i think it's quite a high target and i'm even a bit worried the minimum target might not be met. Mostly because the market is just so unsure right now, although you can now pick up some cheap ETH most people are afraid to make moves.  But who knows how the markets will be by the time the ICO starts. A lot can change in just a few days in crypto.",neu
Similar projects are not a problem - there are several ways to be highlighted among your competitors. But I'm not so confident about the max cap. Market is saturated with ICOs and this one will be affected too. Hope they can develop their project anyway.,neu
"  Yes, it would be interesting to know how bots behave on extreme news fluctuations",neu
"   Well, the true difference will be in the algorythms results, but you can't know this before the product is already made ",neu
What Napoleonx have unique from other artificial intelligence exchange trading projects? i just found few others and interested in comparing qualitys of the projects,neu
"   It takes money, to make money.   ",neu
"   They will be divided through the ICO, so no mining for this one.",neu
I think we need to give this some time before making judgments. LEt's wait and see!,neu
"Nice to see this very active dev. I am curious about the success of these algorithms and yet a little bit sceptical, if they are better than regular bots",neu
Algorithmic trading thrives in volatile markets and the crypto market sure is one hell of ride. But the crypto market is also very susceptible to news and rumors as we have seen this month. I wonder how NaPoleonX will deal with that.,neu
"So basically this is cryptocurrency trading bot? Interesting idea, but you will have many competitors around here. Where I can find more info about this project?",neu
Quite a few comments from people who has a bit difficult to understand the Investor pitch. Perhaps dev can create a simple infographic (ellaborate on the one from the webpage) to understand the concepts of the use-cases from an Investor perspective.,neu
Looks like you guys are already far in development of your algorithm and you sure gave us a lot of material to read with three pdf`s. Does your team consist of three people only? Looks like a lot of work for such a small team.,neu
"Raising money to start a trading house to trade on crypto seems like a no brainer. And some of these similar projects which launched earlier had some really great success and returns. Which bring me to ask, what value does NapoleonX brings to an investor? From your first page description, it is only talks about how much you need to raise and what bot trading can do. If you do raised the money, and NapoleonX makes money using the investors money, what is the investor's reward?",neu
"i'm not really sure about this project but i hope dev and team will keep hard work to realize his destiny. good luck dev and team, waiting for bounty program of the project.",neu
"I hope someone from the team will feedback on the questions asked in this thread, most specificaly I think the securities questions needs to be adressed.",neu
"Looks like another idea to make more easy for investors to handle this complicated crypto world. It might attract more money into this field, so I guess it might be a positive factor for the entire crypto revolution.  However I agree with other comments, it is still a bit not so clear...",neu
"Using bot for trading is something that i interested a lot but never trusted enough to do it.  With this size of product, trust won't be an issue.  But there is another issue is make me think, if napoleonx get successful and have mass usage, so how will it earn money?  For make profit in trading someone should also lose. And if the market becomes one very big trader, who will it gonna beat to make profit?",neu
"So to give an incentive or to give a tool for people that know little to none financing is a very good idea, most people in the crypto world don't have many skills for trading, but they learn anyway in this environment, but is not enough to compete with actual experts in the field, so a bot of this complexity will greatly benefit the common user, BUT, how much market is there for this? I will need to read the whitepaper to grasp more of this idea, I'll be checking this for sure.",neu
"Hi there dev, this looks very promising. Trading bot for cryptos. However, this kind of tech will surely rise some eyebrows especially to those people who are critical to trading bots.  Trading bots as far as I know, are also heavily used by trading companies and banks to trade for the money of investors in their institutions. And the results varied but it's around 8% to 25% win per day. Sometimes they are even better than real humans. Because humans are emotional people, they are easily affected by what's happening in his environment. While bots they are not affected by any outside noise. They only read the graph and the algorithm, and they get smarter and smarter.  I have some questions myself. Does this tech (trading bots) will run alongside with real people also trading in your system or will it only be all trading bots?  Will there be time that the bot will lost some trades? In the event that it will happen, what will happen to the money of investors? Is there a backup plan in such events?",neu
"   I just scanned the website and whitepaper, but can't seem to find the function of the NPX token itself. Will check in more detail later.  Anyone from the team that can elaborate?",neu
"   Thanks, looked at the website before posting but apparently not to well. I find the Project interesting but the webpage makes me dizzy by just looking at it",neu
this looks interesting. but will the investors receive a part of the profit? I haven't seen anything about that. TAAS for instance give a quarterly payment of 50% of the profit generated. Will you do something similar?,neu
"  I'm not sure with the fee but I think it's possible for this to get listed in Binance DEX, however, I'm concern about the volume since this DEX is still in the launching stage. Let's see how the market respond..",neu
If it can implement on real life then it might be useful and team may invest money to list on exchange otherwise the team may abandon the project.,neu
"   Unlimited exchanges and no accounts, it looks easier and simpler, it seems to be more interesting but worries still exist. Security is what we always want.",neu
brother I join you.. how to fund it?  I not sure this will be top100 coin.. but every day more dev on github more partnerships..,neu
Even they are working on this product but due to low exchange support is killing the momentum of this platform. If they will hire a talented person for marketing purpose than it could help this to get back into same momentum where it was in the beginning of this project.,neu
"   I too hope so, the only thing i am a bit skeptical about is the lack of marketing we see nowadays. Maybe that area will also be covered when they launch next month. New dapps announcement and faster deployment will help the price. I dont think new exchanges will help when the platform gets ready since the use of trust coins on the platform always gives one the chance to lend your coins in order to make the platform a success.",neu
"As the price continues to plummet, not much to enjoy after reading the update. The ROSCA app that was supposed to launch still doesn't have and ETA (I know it's better to launch when all is ready, but considering they said it was ready almost ready a while ago...), and the fact that they have a new website doesn't seem that ""wow"" considering the size and expectations of this project. All for the best I guess #bearmarketiscoming   ",neu
would be nice for the team to launch an official statement at the beginning of july some concrete stuff is welcomed,neu

To be completely honest. The logo and arguably the name is so bad people have been skipping over it. It was just mentioned in a few very large groups with very active traders. I would not sell any anytime soon if I got in on the ICO lol. I just got a bunch and its because of the concept and team.,neu
There is no established ico price. Participants will get trst proportionally to their investment. We will know the final price in less than 12 hours.,neu
What is the minimum amount to be raised that will suffice for this project to go ahead?,neu
Wow congratulations.  Hope it will add more reliability on this project which I am actually doubtful before. Who knows.,neu
"   The team is yet to finalize this,they are busy with the ICO currently",neu
"   Hey,  The price of tokens is not fixed. So the final price of the tokens will be determined once the ICO ends. ",neu
I think it will go down but it will be only temporary and the price will go back up again but not much. The recent increase in price coming from optimism side who believed that ETF will be approved. Doubts might arise because of the delayed decision (purely my opinion).,neu
The maximum is fixed at 6k BTC,neu
No doubt it is a good project and getting so much funding in such a short period is great but I am afraid it would be over priced.,neu
"This looks interesting. Though some previous ""insurance"" that tried crypto did not really work out.  Is there already information about escrow?",neu
@modernbuddha  I live in Japan but I feel it is expensive. I want to hear opinions from other people.,neu
Do you have any plans to list your ICO on icocountdown.com?  It's a really good site to create awareness among the crypto community,neu
I'll be waiting) I hope the conditions will be as transparent as possible for the investor.,neu

Hello Dev .. What are your plans with incent projects in the future Are there new features and innovations for this development,neu
Should be around on Slack somewhere - I'll dig it out for you if you're there.,neu
I was trying to find today the whitepaper of incent. Where can I read your whitepaper ?,neu
"   You don't get AUD every 5 minutes. You get INCNT worth of 0,05 AUD.",neu
But I get AUD every 5 Minutes and not INCT and now I get AUD and it exchanges automatically to INCT?,neu
"   Incent are traded on Bittrex, plus Waves DEX. You won't be able to withdraw your balance from the toolbar until KYC is implemented, so that we can remain compliant. That's on the way.",neu
"   It's most likely that your INCNT balance is the same, but the AUD value has changed due to standard crypto volatility (BTC has been pretty choppy recently).",neu
"Guys, I'm new to Incent. I have some incents ... but what can I do with them Did not quite understand.",neu
It is beta version of the toolbar for chrome browser this is what I got from last update. Actually I wanted to understand what is the function of toolbar extension and impact on my privacy and search results. I will ask openly is thins some kind of tracking or cookies type thing to understand the search behavior of the user ? I didn't find detailed information in lats article that's why want to have clear idea about this extension.,neu
"Another bug I found:  When you are on a website with a menu at the top (i.e. Twitter), you can't see the menu anymore because the toolbar is right above it. Hope you can fix that",neu
That's on the way but the priority right at this moment is getting the toolbar functioning perfectly.,neu
A couple of seconds only. The app only asks for name and country of residence if I remember correctly.,neu
"   What about their KYC process to get reward? Anybody knows the KYC steps, how long it takes?",neu
"By the initial post of ANN is a 2016 project, but I have a question, how will I earn those rewards informed on the website: It lets you earn rewards, not just when you spend money, but whenever you do life online .?",neu
How many businesses and how many customers have used the Incent Layalty program so far?,neu
"  Yes, that's the case. This is basically the decision interested investors have to make now: Do I wait until the end of ICO with investing and hope for an increasing Waves price or do I do it now? Sometimes it works in your favor, sometimes not.",neu
"Guys, feel free to join our Slack with already little more than 370 members. Be it to ask questions, look for support or to simply have a chat. See you there!  https://incentinvites.herokuapp.com/",neu
"   The social presence is not that visible when compared to some project, that has been my issue with TVE, good site but the coverage is an issue to me, I hope things will improve with time",neu
will the ICO just keep going until it gets to have 5Million marketcap even after 2 months? This could take forever if this happens and our coins are going to stay freeze for longer period of time.,neu
"   Is it working? Because I don't see it moving down and well, now I refreshed the page and the countdown goes up  It's a great project, maybe the devs choosed the wrong time to start the ICO since we saw a lot of good ICOs this month and on the last month.",neu
@incentDev you should probably add counter of total Incent count and put it here https://www.incentloyalty.com,irr
"   Me too, we can't see how many incent tokens have sold out so far, so i hardly estimate thar figure, maybe 30 million.",neu
"   My rough estimate is less than 50 mllion Incent. The longer the ICO duration, the lesser supply of Incent will be created.",neu
Still trying to figure out what the total supply will be once the ICO is over... can anyone here give an estimate?  thanks,neu
ok they lookin/thinkin over it again,neu
"   Hmm, no - that's what we collected in the first week! Maybe we'll see a nice surge in the last 24 hours, but that's a ways down the line yet!",neu
You guys really couldn't of used a different name? Its a great project and all but the name is just not right...,neu
"Incent team, would the surge in either Bitcoin or Waves token impact our token numbers. I see you fixed the token price against BTC but in $ terms  it is increasing which is good for the team but for we investors I don't know how we can benefit from this increase.",neu
been reading about other ico's and i noteced Incent is not added to http://icotracker.net/ is it intentional or team not aware of this site? Maybe Incent banner should be added there to attract more potential investors? Or summ which is collected already is sufficient to continue business and lower ammount of tokkens means higher value upahead?,neu
Is there a running count somewhere of hoe much has been invested already?,neu
Is there any way by which we can know how many tokens have been generated so far?,neu
I thought it would be great but it looks like I need to see incent really have a good team and are in the development of this project in the future,neu
"guess thats ok for the first    what about if investment cap will not be reached by end of ICO? I dont think that will happen, just for clarification.",neu
I am invested a small amount on ICO so far. I am thinking about to invest some more. I am still not completely convinced how this project is able to scale big. Could you already name some merchants which will partner Incent?,neu
"   Great, but in my opinion landscaping eCommerce its not such good for loyalty programs. I mean,  how often people use landscaping goods? One time in 3-6 month or etc. I would like to see  some mass eCommerces, where people buying goods everyday. Anyway, I bought something amount today  ",neu
The price is calculated according to Brave New Coin's index: http://bravenewcoin.com/waves#Trading-Pairs,neu
I want to invest some money. but I am actually confuse to join or not. because My lots of money already blocked in so many ICO's. and ICO take many weeks to finish and distribution. and some time it sucks you know? but this investment graph attracting me and getting my attention.  only 17 hours remaining to price increase.. Well. I'll think few more hours about this and decide.. I'll join this anyway. if not in first stage then in another stage.,neu
"   TY, I still decide to invest or not, so I need more information about incent token sold to calculate the market cap- to assess the price/market cap is overvalued or undervalued. Not only me, other people wanna know it as well.",neu
"Where can we see how many incent tokens have sold? In other word, what is the current incent supply? Thanks, i can't find it on the ico panel, only btc and waves invested can be found.",neu
"I'm still on the fence. Is it possible for Incent to exceed Waves in value? Another question; say I buy 1 Btc worth of Incent which will get me 10,000 units now. Will the number of units I own decrease by the end of the ICO?",neu
Am I the only one who thinks the logo looks like a carrot?,neu
"Would appreciate if somebody can answer my question on Twitter.  https://twitter.com/CryptoPioneer/status/782479541059063808  ""@IncentLoyalty Will merchants have to pay for Incent loyalty tokens?""  Thanks!",neu
"the more i read about Incent project, the more i want to let loose my btc.  however, i see that for last couple of days there is not much funding coming through. hmm.. i think i should wait another 24 hours before making a final decision as there is no cap for price increase till 4th Oct. maybe a lot of people share my mindset since price will remain the same regardless of no. of tokens sold.

"Any interviews that talking about this coin, from the developers?",neu
"    Thanks for your response. The word ""loyalty"" is causing confusion and I've seen this in every interview.   Unless there's legal concerns, why isn't this explained as an Instant Digital Cashback Network - A network to challenge loyalty programs?  With all the negative press regarding data mining store cards in Australia, a loyalty program vs cashback network alternative would gain press attention.  It's not a challenging concept at all when explained like this.  Market as loyalty for business and reward cashback to their consumers.",neu
Can someone explain to me what the loyalty industry is?,neu
I am little giddy on this one but must follow this. It seem promising but wave still logs behind schedule.,neu
"I've invested, but I'd be interested in thoughts on this -  The value of incent rises and merchants want to continue to reward their customers with incent.  Unfortunately, due to incent's value, it's only feasible to reward customers with a percentage of incent.  Merchants are now rewarding customers with 0.001 incent.  This reduces incent's perceived value for loyalty participants upon their introduction as theyre not even receiving a whole token.  Bitcoin has this issue. People want to own at least ONE of something.  When customers recieve 2000 flybuys, they're excited and have no idea of the value. Having 2000 of something just seems like a big deal and generates interest.  If a merchant sells a product for $5, theyre not going to be able to reward with whole incent tokens forever - even at the 25c low cap, there's an adoption issue.  Why so little coins from the start and why the cap, why not change it?   This all seems quite obvious from a marketing perspective, so am I missing something here?  Is the goal not mass adoption?",neu
What % of premine is retained by the Incent team?,neu
something new in cryptoland.  could this be the miles program to cyptocurrencies? or is this similar to the rebate system of Plutus?,neu
"   That's absolutely impossible to say, without more information. Specifically, your timeframe, amongst other things  Return will be a function of merchant adoption (buy pressure) and initial market cap, which we won't know until the end of the ICO.",neu
"   You can deposit bitcoin from any address, exchange or own wallet. If you're in any doubt, try a small test transaction first. If you're depositing Waves, you should NOT use an exchange, only your own wallet (download at www.wavesplatform.com)",irr

This will be implemented before withdrawals are enabled.,neu

reading whitepaper soon,neu
Is there already a roadmap or timeline of major milestones/features release?  How long after ICO will the tokens be distributed? When to add exchange and is the project already in contact/agreement with major exchanges?,neu
Total tokens depends on the amount raised and the rates at which people buy tokens.,neu
No. The price of Incent will depend only on demand for Incent. RW.,neu
From what i read from the website the ICO is open until they get 5 Million USD in capital /fund will just wait for further announcement.,neu

I don´t think Loyyal can get it since we are talking more about a concept than something concrete.,neu
Did you know Loyyal is trying to get a patent on using a blockchain for loyalty rewards?  Personally I doubt if they'll be successful but I guess they must think they have a chance.,neu
"  Well, I guess it's true. You are all correct about the collaboration and support thing. Any projects without supporters or partners are nothing. I guess that is what is all about, we live in a world of harmony and relationship to a group of people and individuals.

"   Thanks! We currently use SHA256 in the Betanet and are still doing some tests with different memory-bound PoW algorithms regarding efficiency and support.  On memory-bound hashes, the mining speed is bound by the memory latency. GDDR5 memory on latest graphic cards does not have a relevant latency benefit (if at all) compared to DDR3/DDR4 which is used by the CPU. We'll have to try it out, but our target is to be solely memory-latency-bound because this will reduce power consumption of miners (basically putting your CPU into waiting for memory most of the time).  We are confident we will make the right choice for the final Mainnet PoW and we'll update it here for you to take in consideration.",neu

Will the lighting network be implemented when nimiq launched on December? or in Q1 of 2018,neu
"    The mainnet is scheduled for Q1 2018, this includes lightning network.",neu
"   We like to be a bit under the radar while we are fully prepared to launch the Mainnet. Our niche is not web mining, is a simple and scalable decentralized payment protocol native to the web, browser mining is just a feature ",neu
"  I think this works just fine, but I also think that running the browser with optimal access to CPU and memory will be faster. a VPS is usually hosted on a server. The server itself usually runs multiple Virtual Machines in order for the cloud provider to cover hardware costs. This results in a share of CPU and memory in virtual machines even if you (as the customer) don't see that. So performance could be slower than having your own server for example. If you manage to obtain a private VPS you could rent the hardware just for yourself but this is usually 10 times more expensive compared to a simple VPS in the cloud",neu

"   Hey, cc  'Based on the changing regulatory environment, our legal counsel has driven us to require this KYC process (anticipated in the NET Creation Terms). This goes along with the same restrictions regarding sanction lists, politically exposed persons, as well as restrictions for certain jurisdictions (ie. USA) as previously experienced during the NET Contribution Process. This will permit the Nimiq project as a whole to maximize probability to comply with regulations in various jurisdictions and thus support the underlying factors regarding Nimiq mainstream adoption in the future.'  -network/roadmap-to-mainnet-ee557efd74d4",neu

"You people are idiots. The KYC is not for creating a wallet or mining. It's for initial swap participants and is same as ICO T&Cs. The regulators are cracking down, all ICO/swaps will have to do this or risk being delisted, shutdown, fined or imprisoned.",neu

   Please go ahead and ask them,neu
"   I can feel your frustation. We are doing KYC only for users using our NET-to-NIM replacement tool because for Nimiq Foundation to be encompassed on a safe road to mainstream adoption (from all regulations perspectives). We are not fans of KYC and know it can be a frustrating process so we are trying to keep it as easy as possible while still complying to regulations.  We are still defining the KYC provider. We have narrowed it down to a few of them and we are analyzing the best fit to a global userbase. We expect an easy-to-follow (other than excluding US citizens). We will inform more details as soon as we have definitive information from our KYC provider.  Yes, so you noticed the identicons. Identicons are a huge UX accomplishment that makes us and our community super proud. Join our telegram or discord groups to discuss about it and understand while this aspect lowers barriers of entry to newcomers.  Do you have any specific concerns about 'losing your holdings' from s technical point of view if you have NET tokens there is no way to lose them unless you lose your private key.

We understand the frustration that was created by the KYC requirement. Probably you have been following Nimiq for some time now and you got to know us well enough to know that this legal requirement was a very bitter pill for us to swallow. We’d strongly prefer to save you this hassle, but we have to be compliant with money laundering laws to build a clean legal foundation for the future of Nimiq.

"   in case it wasnt clear what i was talking about:  Nimiq Foundation (you) create the ERC-20 token. Nimiq Foundation (you) sells the ERC-20 token for promise of future NIM Coins on Nimiq Network (browser based blockchain, no cryptocurrency). Nimiq Foundation (you) create the Nimiq Network. Nimiq Foundation (you) set the parameter to issue NIM Coins to miners. Nimiq Foundation (you) are the first to mine...  now there are two ways to look at the next step: 1. you BUY BACK OUR ERC-20 Token for your NIM coin at a fixxed rate, actually, your are my customer and i dont want kyc from you. 2. we call it exchange, i change my NET Token on Ethereum for NIM on Nimiq. (now i see both scenarios doesnt have to include kyc) --you really should have collected kyc at the net sale. do it now makes no sense whatsoever. because:  Nimiq Network mainnet goes live. Nimiq Network continues to create NIM Coin, issued to miners (anonymous users of the nimiq network)  now i dont know your numbers, lets say 20% of all users are KYC victims (very high risk of getting identity stolen). 80% anon users at mainnet.  whatever happens on the nimiq network is ultimately nimiq foundations creation. each NIM created by the automated process of creating nim for work on the network is issued by the NIMIQ foundation.  now if you say you can only exchange NIM for NET if we provide KYC ultimately means that in future you, HAVE TO get KYC from EACH and EVERY user of the NIMIQ Network because each address holds a share of the networks wealth. it can only be used if people provide kyc. simple as that. imagen you are the new visa, visa work without documents? no.  but if you say ""we buy back your NET for our NIM"" then KYC is no issue. dont forget, there is no law and we have to work on creating laws for crypto/blockchain/ico that work. kyc in this case is only a ""lets go the save route"" for current laws that dont apply to the situation, which may destroy your reputation.  one of the biggest issue is that you want a 3rd party to controll the kyc data. your security doesnt matter here. kyc data will be stolen or sold at one point in time.

We strongly disagree, after studying every option carefully It is the safe and responsible way to do it, if you think different is your personal (uninformed) opinion. You're entitled to it, but if you think it is 'lazy, cheap and irresponsable' your are plain wrong, is exactly the opposite. How can we guarantee all that?

"   We do guarantee that by using the best providers available with the safest and strictest regulations possible. Our KYC provider is currently used by businesses like Coinbase and Bittrex, where the data of the users is also very sensitive. We are paranoid about security too and we are trying everything in our hands to keep the information of users safe.   i know you try to make me mad by calling me uninformed but you see me throwing around facts and carefull selected questions you cant seem to able awnser.  thats exactly what we need now, people with opinions. thats the only way stuff gets regulated the right way.  but i know using a 3rd party provider saves you so much work and money that there is no way in these times that you could do this yourself. or could you? and maybe save the data securely encrypted inside of your chain. but why bother, its just the legal status of nimiq, lets hand this over to a 3rd party. noone can blame us if we loose the data.  And again, this is plain, unaltered, out-of-the-box FUD  . You are saying we are giving information to a third party so we avoid responsibility in case of data loss? No, we most definitively are not.  As I stated before, using a third party KYC provider is the safe and responsible thing to do. It is madness to think a Blockchain Startup would dedicate time and effort building a one-time-only KYC infrastructure!. We would not be able to focus on what we do: Native Payment Protocol to the Web. It is, from all points of view, the wisest decision to use a provider who actually dedicates to the complex business of ID verification and anti-money laundering filtering. It is super delicate too, and these guys have been doing it for years with sensitive information like passports verification for flights and crypto platforms. If you analyze it objectively I think the decision makes a lot of sense.

We want to be the leading payment protocol for the Web, this is a totally different field than Ethereum, these are different times than the time when Ethereum launched, and more importantly, we are a whole different project. In the future we might need to partner with E-commerce sites, Web Platforms, International Community, and... who know what new technologies will emerge in the future. Our research has demonstrated we will have a higher opportunity to succeed in our main goal if we require KYC in these part of the process, that way we are safe and ready for regulation and rules any of these organizations, it is not only governmental regulations we have to be prepared for.

But I think that for that to happen we have to find a happy medium with the current regulations and continue moving forward to that dream. I'm really sorry if KYC is a true problem for you, I can tell you really support us and is not nice to ask a user to go through a process that they feel unhappy about. I really do hope you can understand our point of view and the reasons why we are doing this, and also continue supporting us.  I can conclude by telling you we honestly care a lot about the user's personal information, it will remain in the KYC provider only as long as strictly needed by us, and then they will delete it completely. And also that we wouldn't do this process if we didn't believe it will boost our potential for mainstream adoption. I hope you understand and I see around our community some time soon ",neu

   I bought my Nimiq on Liqui and don't want to do KYC. What are my options here? Am I pretty much going to be forced to sell now?,neu
  Sell now.,neg
   You can wait for NET and NIM to be listed simultaneously and trade NET-BTC BTC-NIM or something like that.,neu
"    We recommend to do it as soon as possible. In the next couple of weeks we will announce the cut-off date, but we suggest to users to get done with  because, even though we will support Activation after mainnet launch, it will be a slower process because you would have to get in contact with us and prove ownership of your NET, now is just automatic using our tool.",neu
"   What exactly do you mean by ""if you want to be in control of your NIM ...""? Your sentence is quite strong, even beyond a simple recommendation. Also, the information I gave above was from personal activation experience and from info I got from discord mods. There are security, usability, liquidity, speculation etc reasons for not activating. Can you be explicit please what are the consequences of NOT activating now, so the community can make better decisions?  Thank you.",neu

At that point we will close entry to the Genesis Block and activations after that may carry delays and/or involve additional manual efforts. To secure your spot in the Genesis Block and due to expected KYC processing bottlenecks, we highly recommend you proceed and activate your NIM for NET soonest.

I try it.  but the hit is no more available coin. I feel sad,neu
"   I am not from the Nimiq team.  - they would never openly suggest how to bypass the KYC, to not be liable. - post-mainnet, the NET price will have as floor (and presumably as ceiling too) the conversion rate price 1 NET = 100 NIM. There will likely be arbitrage above/below the conversion price by everyone and their dog.",neu

   No. Liqui will not activate your NIM for you. You have to do it yourself!.  We strongly recommend you withdraw your NET to your OWN Ethereum wallet and then use that wallet to activate your NET.,neu
"Now in every new ICO important and with a good team and project you have to do the KYC, and soon it will become mandatory also in the exchange if we want to continue operating, especially those that support the FIAT credit transfers.  So I believe that every user must now learn to do well the kyc and have all the documents already available .... once done the first, then they are almost all the same and ask all the same things.",neu

Its tough but thats the truth  Bittrex has compulsory KYC for all accounts now, Cryptopia does not but they are not in the US  Nimiq allowed US investors so they have to do KYC to be legally complaint   Just cos they are doing KYC that doesnt mean they are ""scamer coint""  ",neu

fully premined by Nimiq Team right? so initially Nimiq Team has full access of the circulating NIM then 'manually' distributing it through the KYC portal,neu
"the NET activation process is being done by premining NIM on Nimiq blockchain then distribute it ""manually""?I thought there will be smart contract linked to Nimiq blockchain that will automatically credit balances by linking my current Ethereum address to Nimiq address on blockchain, then sending NET to the smart contract",neu
"I honestly think there should be 2 kind of clients, an online one for convenience and another downloadable client with checksum and source hosted online for generating wallets",neu
   Not at all. All users that participated in Activation before cut-off date have complete control of their NIM because their accounts are hardcoded in the Genesis Block with the initial funds from Activation Process.,neu
"   Is exactly the same questions you asked and we discussed in our Telegram group. Are you trying to FUD?.  NIM is not Ethereum based, there are no Smart Contracts in the Nimiq Blockchain. Nimiq Exchange Token (ERC20 Token used to Activate NIM) is based in Ethereum. when you use your NET to activate NIM you send the NET to an Ethereum Burn Addresse. We took a snapshot of the Ethereum Network a few Days ago (cut-off date) and all people that had to activate NIM used NET will receive their funds immediately the moment we Launch. NIM that were not activated will have to be activated by us and will remain in our control until the NET Holders use NET to activate them (they have up to 6 months to do so).",neu

I tried to figure out how does the script works but there's something I don't understand. Maybe it's dumb, but anyway.  If I look at the source code of the page (just the HTML, not the javascript), there are the following lines: Code: payment: {             storePublicKey: 'aQw3WcSPGnZ4c6LRvA5KC7XcGpSWd',             amount: 200000  The amount is equal to the 2 NIM in the atomic unit (there are 5 decimals). But I don't understand the address format (storePublicKey): the button make the payment go to NQ71 84LL P739 CXRF 4KU7 A829 DEML T8P4 75T1, but in the HTML page the address is aQw3WcSPGnZ4c6LRvA5KC7XcGpSWd, so if I want to put my own address, what format do I need to use?  Thank you.  PS: I looked at the javascript but I don't know this language, but there is almost nothing about addresses",neu

"   Check here : -org/skypool-nimiq-miner/releases/  It depends if you have AVX2 (or AVX512F) or no. I didn't check for you, but there are several ways to know it.  If it doesn't have AVX2, then use the latest release (1.1.3). If not, I guess you should use the v 1.0.0 (fast or extreme) but I'm really sure.  To verify if it's working properly, the compat version 1.0.0 makes around 2x more than the browser official miner. So with the last version, it should be more. Running Linux, the version 1.0.0 makes around 3/4x the browser hashrate, and the last version (still on Linux) makes 4/5x the browser's hashrate. I don't know if it's useful for you, but if it can help...  Edit : Skypool miner is unofficial and is NOT open source. See this post.",irr

This doesn't erase your account's information but you can create a backup of `%LocalAppData%\Nimiq` to be sure. Full nodes need to perform a database upgrade that takes ~1 min. Light nodes need to resync. Pool operators should make sure their users upgrade as well. Pool Server does not include the new version yet but we advice pool operators to manually upgrade to v1.1.1. Pool Server will be upgraded with other fixes very soon.,neu

ASICs are made for one a'd only one algorithm, so there is no flexibility. GPUs are in the middle : less flexible than CPUs but way more than ASICs. So if making an ASIC miner for Nimiq seems really difficult, maybe making a GPU miner can be kess difficult. Really, O don't know this algorithm much, so I can't evaluate the possibilities.

You can check GitHub for that. There is even a nice video that dates September:   We (Nimiq Community) are building a decentralized payment protocol. The whole idea about a decentralized payment protocol is that it is resilient and censorship-resistant, in other words: it works without you having to trust ANY third party and is very difficult (for all considerations impossible) to block/freeze any user's account/transaction.

Crying out loud doesn't help. The Team provided the platform and network they initially announced in the whitepaper and token sale terms.

I shared a video of THE FIRST meetup and explained that he also didn't participate in this meetup even though he was in the next room coding. - There are 3 founders, a Team of developers and an entire community behind Nimiq. - This is all true.

Not saying his contributions are not important, but your statement is not quite valid.  2- Nimiq core-rs Rust implementation of the Nimiq Node. Released this month and already has one open PR from a community member.  3- Nimiq Apps  Nine Apps made by the Nimiq Team, 16 built by community developers.

"   The ICO was held in ETH and ETH is -60% since ICO. With their current holdings (according to numbers and projection from transparency report) they could buy give back all the ETH raised and still own some millions   2. They raised 12 million dollars, while the project market cap is only 2 million dollars, but instead they bought a 1.2 million dollar villa in Costa Rica. I didn't know that a villa in Costa Rica is more expensive than a villa in Las Vegas.  - The market cap below book value is an interesting thing and happens in stock markets as well. The general advice by most stock traders is to buy in these cases - but of course stocks work differently than crypto currencies. - I have not read any message that they bought a villa in Costa Rica. Last thing I heard is that the place they're working from (and seen in the videos) is rented. Can you point me to the source of that information?   3. In one year for launching the project, they spent nearly 5 million dollars without doing any marketing. Pretty much they wash ICO money, steady, but surely. Doing marketing will burn all the money.  In the transparency report they claimed to still have about 12 Mio. USD in assets, which is about the same value of their ICO. This is a sign for a good and healthy diversification strategy.   4. They spent so much money on developers, while the developers best app is Nimipet a fucking joker game with 100 users daily.  I think the developer funds are needed to develop the platform, blockchain, technology... Nimiq is not a dapps platform, so it makes no sense to look into dapp success on the platform.   5. At the moment, the burning rate according to their previous report before starting the marketing is 250,000 dollars per month.  I don't know if the 250k figure already contains marketing expenses. Proper marketing is nothing that you turn on and get within an hour or days, it's something that takes months. So it could well be that marketing expenses were already included. In fact their transparency report states that 22% of their expenses were into marketing and community building.   6. A mining pool was closed due to financial troubles aka Philpool. Another mining pool is set to be closed tonight.  It needs a proper financial plan to run a mining pool. That is the same for other currencies. Try to start a bitcoin mining pool and tell me how much you earned vs. how much you paid after one year...   7. Robin (main guy) and founder of the project left the project about 7 months ago. 8. They keep lying that Robin is doing a secret top notch research, while he left the project.  You are claiming this over and over again although it was already stated to be false. If you can't provide any inside info nobody else has that proves your claim, shut it up.   9. The community is full of bots to make us believe that the community telegram is growing. 10. They use a trading bot to create fake volumes and set the market cap at fixed 2 million dollar. 11. Nimiq REAL VOLUME is less than ~ 10,000 dollars, the rest of it is FAKE VOLUME generated by trading bots.  Nice claims, can you prove them? Also, what would be wrong if it is true that they buy back to hold the 2 milling dollar market cap? This gives safety to investors as they won't loose everything if they can always sell at a fixed price.   12. They paid shillers like Shay, the guy from Twitter to shill the shit out of nimiq.  First you complain about them not doing marketing and then you complain about them doing marketing. Also, you lack proof here again...   13. Except 30 people, the rest of the community left the project definitely with huge loses.  I am pretty sure I've seen more than 30 people in the community. I've seen more active users on Discord and the blockchain shows more than 6000 active accounts with a balance of more than 1000 NIM.   14. CPU mining only, while people started mining using GPU rigs for months!!!  Where does it say CPU mining only? I think they were outright honest that at some point there will be GPU miners or even ASICs. They just chose their algorithm in a way that makes them not 10 times more efficient. In fact, numbers from GPU miners suggest that their Hashrate/Watt is similar to good CPUs.   15. With their current stats they will become bankrupt. It will be exactly an ""internet bubble"" company and all nims will go to dust! They just need to press the killswitch  Technically, there is no killswitch. Most of the nodes running in the network are not hosted by the Nimiq Team. The fact that, due to their browser technology, every browser becomes a node in the network, results in it being pretty much impossible to turn off all nodes, because it is so incredibly easy and lightweight to start one.",irr
"   You continue to shit shit so when in 2019/20 Nimiq will ascend and show everyone its value, you will disappear from oblivion while we investors will be rich and happy.  When this happens, you will probably change nick and choose another coin / token to attack",neu
"   If you invested 100 USD into Bitcoin a year ago, your investment is probably also worth about 16 dollars now. Is Bitcoin dead as well?   2. They bought a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica. Read the fucking transparency report. It shows clearly that now they have a 1.1 million dollar villa describe as an asset. I don't think they bought the villa before the ICO.  They did neither mention they bought a villa, not that they did anything in Costa Rica. All they wrote is that they diversified into real estate.   3. They spent over 5 million dollar in the first year. Probably in 2019 they will spend another 5 million dollars for the software development (RUST, design, etc...) and market study. By the end of the next year, the project will simply be bankrupt and close exactly like Beepool without any warning.  The project can not close. That's by nature in a decentralized network. The team is no longer necessary to run the network or blockchain.   4. Their burning rate per month is higher than 250,000 usd because now it includes extra costs of traveling, more people in the team (they hired a bunch of newbies), marketing boat, etc. Probably for the moment, the burning rate per month is about $350,000.  Might be true, might be false. Still doesn't change a lot.   5. Beepool and Philpool both closed this week due to lack of keeping the joke alive for too much. The project just became worthless and it is just keeping alive. Like internet bubble, there will be a day when we will read a medium post: ""Unfortunately, due to the high cost of the project, we need to shutdown the nimiq network. But still the source will be available on GitHub""   6. Robin lost a lot of weight ( ~ 50kg ) and you can see this by comparing the last videos from April with the really videos. Also there is a huge change in the mindset of Robin and the way he is looking in the camera. Most of the people from the nimiq community believes that Robin lost weight due to the fact that Robin used to consume coke and eventually he became an crack addict. In Central America coke is definitely way cheaper than in other places. This is the simple reason why at the moment Robin (the main guy) is not present in  the videos and he lost a lot of weight  Can you please stop that ""Robin (the main guy)"" thing? The team repeatedly said that they are organized democratically and there is not a single main guy.   7. Somebody proved that the volume of NIM is totally fake. They either run a trading bot by themselves losing money or they paid an exchange to report fake volume to Coin Market Cap  Here is the finding of a user who posted the proof of the volume bot on reddit     Somebody made accusations. There is no proof and part of his statements were shown to be wrong in the replies.   8. Why they pay shillers at all? The team said in many times that they will never use the shitcoin shillers to shill  Who decides what is a valid advertising strategy with evangelists and what is paying shitcoin shillers? Not you.   9. The active community is less than 30 people. Do you want me to count the active users in the last 30 days? Everybody else left the project for good. Including Robin the main guy  Yes, please count them and list all of them by name here so I can verify your countings. Thanks.   10. The killswitch are the seed nodes. If there wasn't any killswitch why in the world they have seed nodes and they keep them online. Moreover, a few months ago when they used to have problems with the seed nodes many of the users complied on discord that they couldn't use the safe wallet. By the way, the seed nodes cost more than $20,000 per month for the team to maintain it. Why it costs so much? Simply, the project is not salable and it will never be salable. Nimiq just transformed itself into an internet bubble that will pop this year, 2019  You can easily add seed nodes, just as any other altcoin, through the configuration file. You only need a single node to be available to continue operating the network. They provide the seed nodes as an additional service. Where did you get the hosting costs of the seed nodes from? The transparency report has a category for ""Digital Operations, Equipment"", which totals to $239k, which is less than $20k per month, but also includes software licenses, hardware costs and so on.",neu
"I see there are a lot of people here are debating about Nimiq, perhaps some people want to open up the truth, in part over again like to believe in the project. But the extent to which they argue even I don't see dev to clarify this. I think they need to clarify and transparent about what they are working on and what steps will you take on this situation.",neu

"   2) you ask for yes or no when it's not a yes/no question 6/7) It's not premined but vested, i.e. most of the funds can not be transferred yet and are locked on the blockchain (for up to 10 years according to their vesting schedule). *) The funds are controlled by the two foundations board (ImpactX Foundation for charity purposed and Nimiq Foundation for Nimiq purposes). I guess those foundations are properly registered non-profits in Switzerland, so there is proper oversight through authorities.  Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on January 03, 2019, 03:34:54 PM After Robin Linus (the founder of the project) left the project, today another nimiq contributior left the nimiq foundation....  “Arthur Gervais, an early contributor and friend to Nimiq, will be leaving the foundation’s board to fully focus on his role as the CEO of @liquiditynet and his academic work (together with #Nimiq). “  As mentioned in your quote and confirmed through telegram, Arther will continue to work with Nimiq Team, he just will step back from the foundation board (that decides on funding as outlined above) to have more time for teaching, research and his own blockchain project.",neu
"   The details of premined coins have been outlined in the transparency report (-network/transparency-report-74d4d89933fe). It was also the first time for me to read about the ImpactX Foundation, but that's fine for me because at that time they had zero usable funds, so no need to announce details at that time. From the report: - Nimiq Foundation (2.5%): 525 Mio NIM, address NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF, 26 Mio NIM unlocked as of today, no transactions yet (funds not used) - ImpactX Foundation (2%): 420 Mio NIM, address NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC, 21 Mio NIM unlocked as of today, no transactions yet (funds not used) - Creators, team and early contributors (2.5%): 525 Mio NIM across multiple address. Hard to track the details. Maybe something to improve for the next transparency report? @Team Nimiq  Also using my genious Google skills, I found Nimiq Stiftung, a non-profit foundation registered in Zug, Switzerland (""Crypto Valley""), the board seems to be half of Nimiq Team and half of externals, with Robin being the president of the foundation, see -portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-164.077.595&amt=ZG Not sure if this is the mentioned Nimiq Foundation from the transparency report and I found no information on ImpactX Foundation, so again, would be nice to get some more information here to get rid of the FUD @Team Nimiq.  Quote from: coinfanatic on January 04, 2019, 08:20:21 AM 2) Why is @normana answering all questions here? Looks like he has inside information. Is he a team member trying to hide his identity behind a pseudonym? 3) ""Did Robin Linus exit scammed the project or did he get into a drug abuse center?"" Why does Robin Linus not end this FUD with a simple video?  2) I only answer questions that have been answered before or can be answered by combining public information with math and logic, no inside information or anything alike, although I know two of the team members from their time before Nimiq (which also might be the reason why I can trust them and the project more than you do). 3) The question was already asked here a few days ago and got replies from the Team, so maybe just look back a few pages.",neu
"   They said the funds are from the ImpactX Foundation charity, implying that a) ImpactX Foundation owns the funds, b) ImpactX Foundation exists and c) they gave the funds to a charity as promised. Just applying logic here...   They are paying people to shill the project to make other people to buy their worthless coins. The action they do was revealed to me. They want for time to passed in order to tell us: ""Guys we spent 12 million dollar and we delivered a blockchain project. This is it. Unfortunately we no longer have ICO money to do anything else"".  Probably richy will post a medium post in mid of this year telling us that they will no longer have funds for the project to continue and team developers in btaches will leave the project. Just like Robin the founder of the project who left the project 8 months ago.  Why would they be interested in people buying other peoples coin, why would they mind? As mentioned above, they don't have a lot of NIM funds that could be sold and those NIM funds that they can technically move at this point have not been moved yet, so every person buying now would not buy from them but from someone else, so they don't earn anything from that.  And again: The last official statement regarding Robin, which was a week ago, is that he is still doing research for Nimiq. My guess would be that the initial research he was looking into was loose end (which is something that can totally happen in research) and he isn't willing to publicly state that without also announcing positive results.   Of course I did read their transparency report with their financial statements. It states clearly that they invested 1.1 million USD into real estate. Namely they bought a VILLA in Costa Rica worth 1.1 million dollars. WHY DID THEY SPEND 1.1 MILLION DOLLAR FROM ICO MONEY TO BUY A FUCKING VILLA WE NEED CLARIFICATIONS WHAT DOES 1.1 million dollar real state means and if they bought a villa worth 1.1 million dollar with the ICO money?  The transparency report says they diversified 1.1 Mio USD into real estate investment. To the best of my knowledge there was no official announcement claiming they bought a villa in costa rica, so everybody saying this is spreading FUD. In general diversifying into more than just currencies is a wise idea, as a financial crisis could easily diminish the value of fiat holdings. If you want to know how exactly this real estate investment works, what are the expected yearly dividends or increase in value or similar details, ask them in a polite fashion here or on Discord or on Telegram. I can't tell you these details, but I also am not an expert in real estate investments, so I just trust them to do something that makes sense (and I guess they are probably getting third-party advice as well before doing a 1 Mio investment).  Best trick to get proper answers is to ask proper questions - don't shout/caps at anyone, don't spread FUD - and you will notice how people start being friendly as well and you don't need to fear being banned.

Providing this information should be possible if your claims of being an ICO investor are true. If you can't provide the requested proof, I will continue to assume that you are only trolling.   also I heard that at the moment they have less than 2 million. In four-five months they will be gone  Interesting information. How did you get them? What did they spend the money on? Maybe file a lawsuit against the Nimiq Foundation Switzerland, as this is supposed to be a non-profit. There is very strict law in switzerland for how non-profits can use their funds.",neu
"What I don't understand is why Robin is not firing the people needed to be fired, its his vision from the start, and in that(whitepaper)/vision people invested in, he need to be the captain, and how does not like  it, needs to go.

"   I agree that the two posts on Reddit aren't insping alot of confidence. However, it's important to read other places of discussion than BCT, because arount 90% of the latest posts here are made by the 5/6 same accounts that registered at the same moment (not long ago), that have the same typing codes (bold caps...), etc... so I don't know if we can really trust them (or him, I don't know).  Edit : BTW, did you notice that those guys never gave proofs of what they were saying, whereas the only people courageous enough to answer to them gave some proofs that are hard to deny?",neu
"     Your proof is a complete failure. First you want to proof their bot was to buy at 2 million usd market cap, but to show that you gave us a chart showing the price of NIM in BTC. As BTC is far from stable to USD, the 2 million USD line should be a curve, not a straight line. Even if this was the correct chart, your line would be crossed by the price in october for a week, which is not the behavior you'd expect from a bot.  Also the factual market cap does not represent you claim. The market cap in early december was touching 1.7 million (according to CMC), so is far less than 2 million. It also stayed below 2 million for several days in early december, which again is not typical bot behavior.  Maybe it's just that around that price, people that trust NIM think the price is too low and will accumulate more?",neu
"Guys, I hate to disagree with you here, but as far as I can tell from the evidence so far the team is doing the right things and Robin was the one that fucked up. We all know what marijuana does to people, it ruins them. The team will figure out a way to kick Robin from the foundation and withhold the money from him. If they can't do this then yeah we have a big problem.  I wouldn't read too much into the fake volume why does it matter it's actually better to have it than no volume at all.",neu
"   To illustrate, here is the proof that you are saying bullshit:  As you can see the curve goes far higher at some moments, and is sometimes under the red line, symbolizing the (real) 2 millions USD market cap. And if you say ""yeah but hey you see it's stabilizing around 2M USD"", I'll answer : you discovered one on the most fondamental tools of technical analysis: supports.  You claim you got proofs but in fact they are not real proofs. You are like medias, you turn things the way you want to make sensational news (even if, again, I agree the actual atmosphere in the project isn't really good).  Also, since Robin is in conflict to the other, I think he will do everything possible to discredit the project, so I wouldn't pay much attention to him for the next few weeks.  And last thing, STOP writing in bold red, it's unreadable. If you want people pay attention to you, then talk like normal people.",neu

This is Mining faster on browser ? I hope that in the future it will be a big thing for this,neu

"    I am not sure what you exactly mean.  Yes, you can mine in a browser but mining is not the really attractive part of this coin. The USP of Nimiq is the fact that it is entirely web based. No need to install anything; you can access the Nimiq blockchain and do transactions completely from your browser. Fast syncing and nice UI really enhance the user experience.  Nimig: making payments easy.",neu
  So you are meaning the team members are not scammers. Great to see you admit it!,neu
"   This might all be true, but there is nothing that you can loose by providing the requested proof to me or to the public. That's like writing your BTC address to the public: the only thing people can do with that is send you funds. So if you would like to have a refund (from me or anybody else) provide the proof or shut up.   in fact, nimiq is a scam which lost all the money from the ICO investors and now they are laundering the money for their own interests and gains.  This can not be a fact because it is a contradicting statement and thus false no matter what: You can not launder money that you lost, if Nimiq lost all their funds there is nothing they can launder for their own interests.  If you describe contradicting statements as a fact, you are either a liar or insane. That is a fact.",neu
"While it should be clear from information publicly available to date, the Nimiq team members would like to establish once and for all that recent accusations of misappropriation are simply wrong. Team Nimiq consists of highly dedicated and hardworking people that deserve better than the spreading of false information that hurt the project and its contributors and consume attention that only distracts from focusing on the tasks at hand.  If the individuals that spread false information would care to listen and to ask actual questions instead of just jumping to conclusions, their and our lives would be much more productive.  So, let’s set things straight:  False Claim: “Robin exit scammed the project and stole money.” Truth: Robin had personal problems and fundamental disagreements with the rest of the team. He declared his intent to no longer work with the project and isolated himself. However, he does not control the project’s funds and he is not able to move funds on his own. All funds remain under the control of the foundation's board which disapproves of his actions. Proof: The wallets that hold Nimiq funds are public. There are no transactions that reflect any unauthorized movements of funds.  Why do you make such unsubstantiated statements? This is equivalent to slander.  False Claim: “The team launders money by buying real estate, you can see in the video that it’s just 250 m, they are building a new mansion for themselves.” Truth: Nimiq acquired 39'062 m2 of Costa Rican soil near the spaces currently used for work and stay. As outlined in the transparency report, this investment was intended as and has proven itself to be a diversified store of value for Nimiq’s assets (bought with BTC when price was around approx. 9k USD), while also providing grounds for potential expansion. Nimiq added three platforms with large tents and two bathrooms, and one larger “rancho” as additional multiuse and workspace for team members. Proof: Find this land development study (made and signed by an external environmental advisor from Costa Rica) with reference to the real extent of the property.  Don’t just assume things from what you see in a video without inquiring about more details. If in doubt, please ask and we will provide proper answers.  False Claim: “Team Nimiq does not support Community Projects.” Truth: Nimiq established a Community Funding Board that aims to give necessary funds to community members to develop projects that contribute to the Nimiq Ecosystem. Neil, a community developer, was hired by one of the pools to improve the existing pool server implementation. In a personal discussion, that Neil asked to keep in private, he complains about a lack of interest in funding his work without sending a formal proposal beforehand. We contacted Neil to encourage him to send his proposal in order to get funded in the regular way that was outlined previously in a Blog Post.  Proof: Formal proposals are publicly available in this Trello board.  If you actually care about the project, please go to Discord, Telegram or Reddit and ask your questions. Don’t spread FUD and insult people, these are the only reasons people get banned for.",irr

"   I answered your ""facts"" from that post already here:  I literally quoted your post and you quoted from my reply so you must have seen that I replied to you. So when you say you never got answers, you are straight out lying here again.  Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on January 16, 2019, 07:51:47 PM The document doesn't look very legit to me, especially because it is signed digitally with somebody's signature and it has a yahoo email address. To many of us it looks totally fake.  Interesting how you comment on a document that was just shared with the text ""To many of us it looks totally fake."". ""us""?  How do you know what many of ""us"" (whoever that is) think? Or is it maybe that ""us"" is just the accounts of nimiqshitcoin, john.btc, coinfanatic, sasha.new, andrewjaxx and Scamiq? Because you seem to be very coordinated, often replying each other within minutes to support each other, always online at pretty much the same time, all of you only used their account to FUD against Nimiq, all of you claim to be highly invested into NIM but never provided any proof even if you could get money for it through my refund.  Talking about SEC without a lot of background knowledge, you are not even an US citizen so SEC wouldn't even apply, SEC actually doesn't apply to Nimiq at all, because their token sale was not reachable from US (not possible to participate due to IP bans) and also asked users to confirm they don't have any US citizenship or greencard before being able to contribute in token sale.  And now you added a reference to Germany, even though everybody knows the project is half-costa-rican, half-german. If I would do a wild guess, these 6 accounts actually belong to just 2 or 3 people from the WebDollar community (bad english, apparently knowledge of romanian language). Maybe consider the possibility your Romanian tech is not superior to other technology and in fact it was proven by some of the Nimiq devs that your WebDollar devs actually stole code from Nimiq. Also did you notice how WebDollar is not on any exchange yet? Maybe Nimiq is actually superior to WebDollar, because right now NIM market cap is something like 2M USD, but WebDollar market cap is just 0. But I can give you one thing: your WebDollars definitely never lost any value.  Quote from: coinfanatic on January 17, 2019, 01:21:42 AM Nothing but piles of lies! ""Workflow of Nimiq Team members during the implementation of the new Nimiq Full Node in Rust"" ... Here is proof there was only 1 commit in the last 4 weeks -rs/graphs/contributors How stupid do you think we are?  I really think you are rather stupid. Please learn how to read GitHub before making any accusations. - Nimiq has more than just one repository, you are only looking at one of them - Contribution graphs only display commits to master, not feature branches that are still in development. - Any commits only pushed to the team internal (non-public) git will not be shown on GitHub at all. - If developers decide to manager their work locally, and/or squash commits, the number of commits will be very low but the resulting code is still worth the same as if it was 10 commits per day.",neu
"   I gave perfectly valid answers. We cannot bother the team to answer all your questions over and over again. They have better things to do than handle you 2-3 people with 6 accounts that just put a lot of effort in spamming this BitcoinTalk thread. Also, you are again contradicting yourself: Either you believe that I am a member of Team Nimiq (even though I obviously am not), then you should be happy with a statement by me if you want a statement from the Team. Or you believe that I am not a member of Team Nimiq, then you shouldn't state that some other person suspects me because it adds no value to the discussion.   When I contributed to the ICO, my IP was not banned. Also, many Americans got into the ICO pre-sale because of this. It is literally impossible to ban all IPs from the United States, and I can confirm the fact that my IP was not banned during the token sale. Moreover, people could have contributed to the token sale being in the States as there was no KYC procedure at the time of the token sale. I am not a native american, but I do have American citizenship.  It is perfectly possible to ban or allow all IP addresses from a country, in fact that's what many websites do. Also you did not even proof you are a ICO contributor, neither proof you are a us citizen. Everybody can claim such things. Nonetheless, when I contributed to the ICO, it clearly asked me if I was a US citizen or not and it also had me confirm the terms (at ) that start with ""IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN, RESIDENT, OR GREEN CARD HOLDER OF THE UNITED STATES OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SALE, YOU CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE CROWDSALE"". Also, if you are a US citizen, you would not have been able to activate your NIM because that process had a KYC, so you must have sold your NET already, which means you cannot be (as claimed) a NIM holder right now, which implies you have no rights for refunds.   Dude, probably you smoked to much pot. All the founders are Germans (Robin Linus, Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Pascal Berrang, Marvin Wissfeld (you) Elion Chin), the rest of the team are just regular employees.  OK, seems like you have some insider information here. In all the VLOGs and their team page () they claim, only Robin, Philipp and Elion are ""Nimiq Creator"" (which to me sounds very much like founder). Also I read that Robin wants a third of the funds which aligns with the narrative of 3 founders. But as you seem to be an insider, you probably know better than me.   I have spotted 2 lies.  Lie no 1. They did not push any code in private repositories for Rust. By default, GitHub is showing as activities including the private commits in private repositories regarding Rust. Lie no 2. I also checked the branches on the rust implementation. There are 3 branches with 5 commits in total. There is only one commit made by Pascal to the Rust implementation on a separate branch in the last 4 weeks.    Oh wow, so much stupidity here. I pointed out 4 things that you didn't consider and you claim that two of these these things are ""lies"", although you show that you actually did not consider before (so basically agree). Also GitHub can obviously only shows activity for things that happen in private commits *on GitHub* which is not what I stated (so you are saying I am lying by changing what I actually said). And finally you attach a screenshot to proof there was only activity on one branch in the last 4 week, when the screenshot actually says ""Updated 21 days ago"" and ""Updated 23 days ago"" for two branches that you did not include in your calculation, so even your proof is proving you wrong. Summary: both of the lies you spotted are in first place not even lies and in second actually do not proof me wrong in any way, I see it more as a confirmation that I was right...  Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on January 17, 2019, 02:05:22 AM Secondly, most of us want a full 1:1 full refund from the team nimiq for every ICO investor.  Most investors don't want full refund at ICO price, the community survey results are very clear:  So it makes no sense to request a refund for every ICO investor. You of course can request a refund for you personally, but you did not provide any proof that you actually are an ICO investor. No proof, no refund, that's so easy.",neu

"   I think you should not confuse the token price with the status of the project. Token price is down. Same goes for almost 99.99% of all other projects including Bitcoin. So that's not a particular feature for this project. It also isn't a measure of success. If that would be the case, Bitcoin and Ethereum would be dead now as well. What we see - to the contrary - is that Bitcoin and Ethereum are more alive than ever; solely a price decline is hardly the signal for a dead crypto project, especially in a bear market.  If you think Nimiq missed the bus of the big Crypto Hype of 2017, I can imagine so. The mainnet release was after the blow off top and little was done to market the project which (from my point of view) deserves a top 100 CMC spot. But did you sell your NET in December 2017? Was it above your entry price then?  Questions about the project's direction are good. They fuel reflection and proper thought processes.

"Team Nimiq answered very clearly in AMA. Robin has left the project but the team still respects the original commitment to spend a third of the project's money paid to Robin during the research process to develop the project.

I revived many messages from their community they started mining webd because consider more profitable. 4. Our Argon2d has different settings => Our miners gives less hash/s but more difficult 5. They had optimized windows miners which allow to mine very fast than browser and most of the miners don't mine anymore in browser. 6. They started to develop the tech 2 years with few millions dollars investment and us in just 6 month without any investment. They released the blockchain with few weeks before us. 7. We want to add anonymity 8. WebDollar has tokens now but doesn't has something user friendly for allowing usage of tokens. 9. They premined 5% for ICO investors and 5% for the team and we premined 9.9% whicl will be use for growing the project. 10. Our miner is designed for easy integration into any website for allowing content creators to monetize their work and reward their communities. 11. We didn't had any marketing until now and we already have thousands of miners and community members on all social networks 12. We did allocate coins from genesis which will be used in our unique build in bounty program which is registering you automatically. 13. Our code is totally different from their code. Maybe they have security issues and we want to ensure everything is working well. So to copy is not an option We already started to develop them in this way and now we have to deliver only like that. The hard part is not argon2d but the communication protocol and digital signatures and making the pool creation very easy.

This means that either you broke the terms (which means you can't really complain about anything, because you can't expect anything else than losses when breaking the law) or you only bought NIM after mainnet launch, which means that you probably lost way less than 90%, because NIM ATH was around 0.006 USD and most of the time the price was actually below 0.003 USD.

They are preparing an EXIT SCAM!  It makes literally no sense to ask other investors to sell their NIM before doing an exit scam, because this would just reduce the amount you can get from the exit scam. Learn basics of economics first.  But to some degree you are right: I am preparing a very special kind of exit scam: My goal is that the FUDers exit the project.

"   Morning! I have posted you proofs on bitcointalk that LTD is interested to close his pool. There was a public conversation with LTD posted on bitcointalk where he says that he is interested to shutdown sushipool   hello scamiqers,  As I posted yesterday, an insider told us that sushi pool will get closed as well. After Neil from nimbet.cc posted that he is totally unprofitable and expresses his willingness to shut down his operations with nimiq and just close the development with nimiq, today we got a short whistleblow from LTD the CEO of sushipool (2nd largest pool of nimiq) confirming 3 things  1. Mining is unprofitable. So, stay the fuck out of mining this scam, unless you want to lose money 2. Sushipool and probably SkyPool are unprofitable. 3. Sushipool will get closed soon due to expensive infrastructure costs and unscalability of nimiq mining.  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:19 PM my questions are if it is profitable to start a mining pool because i have seen other pools closing down their pools  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:20 PM Not profitable atm We can set you a pool if you have the servers ready for a fee  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:20 PM thank you so much i would like to try it by myself i saw there is some tutorial  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:22 PM Ok sure You need Linux experience tho  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:22 PM i work on mac so it is quite the same 1) SkyPool and secondly the unprofitability of the pools the thing is that i don't want to go much into nim because of the factors  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM Then this is not the business for you  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:25 PM ah ok  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM You just answer your question, it’s hard  as you mentioned  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:26 PM i gotcha and if I go into opening a pool for nim how much money should I invest into it? like how much money did you invest into sushi pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:40 PM I can’t discuss that information, but what I can say is that our fee is 500K NIM Server cost could be under $100 depending on the scale  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:43 PM it is quite expensive i was thinking it is quite easy being in javascript but, it looks the opposite being quite expensive and hard to create and mantain  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:44 PM Yep, but still give it a try  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:45 PM another question, any idea if NIMIQ will be able to cover my expenses at least for the first few months running a new pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:46 PM Don't think so, might have to look at it as an investment  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:46 PM yeah, but I don't think running a pool is necessary an investment, it benefit the project to make it more decentralized  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:47 PM true but no pool will burn cash forever, this is why they are shutting down  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:48 PM i guess skypool is profitabile though. Isn't it?  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:48 PM who really knows they (SkyPool) ask for funding so they might not be  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:49 PM oh really i can't imagine why they don't fund pools it looks as a bad idea to run a pool on nim  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:50 PM It's a terrible idea atm, maybe it will improve later  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:51 PM yea it is terrible i guess you spend at least a couple of thousands of dollars per month to cover all the expenses  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:52 PM but again if you wan't us to get your pool online you can let me know  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:52 PM good to know  conversation online at ",neu

"   Even if it was true that they are buying NIM: Buying is not market manipulation. Buying is just buying. If they need NIM for the regular business (for example the community funding board or salaries or whatever) then it is obvious that they need to buy them like everybody else. Also, there is nothing bad about it, it's actually positive for everyone else that has NIM, because it means there is more on the buy side, effectively increasing the price of NIM.  Also, the ""proof"" that ""Nimiq"" keep the market cap at 1.5M USD is horse shit again, because - ""Nimiq"" is a currency, it cannot buy or sell anything, it can only be bought or sold, but that is a passive thing. - Your image is very selective to the last 6 days, because 7 days ago, the market cap as displayed on CoinMarketCap was 1.43M, so below 1.5M which contradicts your theory. - The actual market cap was always way higher than 1.5M. CoinMarketCap does not represent market cap correctly, it is based on a circulating supply of 2.7B NIM, when it actually is 3.1B right now. You can see a more accurate market cap at -cap",neu

"Oh, that will be perfect buying opportunity/  Guys you should research one suspicious project -   They do not deliver promised stuff from Q3 2018",neu
"   Check your math: You are claiming they are buying NIM so the market cap stays above 1.5M USD. Assuming this is true, it would also only cost ~1.5M USD to buy all NIM. So even if they did that, they would still have more than 7M USD left, which is far from running out of money. And, if they buy all NIM, nobody else would own any NIM, so the only stakeholders would be them, so they can do whatever they want and don't have to listen to you at all. Luckily there are quiet some stakeholders that won't sell, because they are in for the technology and long term profit, not for the short term profit.  I think it's funny how some people here on BitcoinTalk log in to the Nimiq Discord or Telegram, write a few messages like ""Nimiq is dead"" and then write a post on BitcoinTalk quoting themselves as ""voices from the community"". Couldn't be less obvious. Also to the few people here that always repeat themselves: nobody is stupid enough to not realize you are just FUDing against the project. But please feel invited to continue: You are bumping the Nimiq thread to the top of the list with every stupid post you do, so you are basically creating awareness for NIM. This is (in my opinion) the only major thing the Nimiq Team wasn't able to deliver yet: proper marketing.",neu
"Long time no see folks.  How's going with the SEC report?  Any news from SEC? Any news from Robin Linus, the pothead founder addict who got removed by his friends from the project to steal the ICO funds?  I see on coinmarketcap that they started a new trading bot buying everything lower to keep the market cap at 1.5 million usd. Too bad for them. If they continue using the trading bot to manipulate the price, miners continue selling all their coins in batches. Probably by end of the summer, the scam nimiq will not even publish a new transparency report because they would run out of all money by then.

"   Thanks for your contribution. I guess I just had slightly different data points (because, as you know, prices in crypto fluctuate a lot). My message (that NIM is more profitable to mine with 1080ti than ETH) is still valid with your numbers (0.004993 ETH = 0.59 USD < 0.87 USD), so thanks for confirming.",neu
"   Did you check the latest AMA  and the financial transparency report mid 2018 -network/transparency-report-74d4d89933fe ? The numbers presented to the public are consistent and they still should have more than 9 Mio. USD worth of assets (even though assets lost value due to bear market). If they had just left the investors funds (60k ETH), they would have less than 9 Mio USD now, so I don't think we can complain about how they used the funds (they most likely could have done better, but that's not the point). Also it seems that they run as a non-profit foundation in Switzerland (""Nimiq Stiftung"", registered in Zug), so any kind of money wasting would probably cause punishment through Swiss authorities.  I think the team should definitely improve on communication, transparency and marketing. The former two mostly to reduce the FUD, marketing to boost the price. If the backing foundation still has more 9 Mio. USD of assets, it's complete nonsense that the market cap of NIM is less than that very same amount.",neu
"   I already deducted the 1.1 Mio USD real estate from the total 9.9 Mio USD, but then it still is a 8.8 Mio USD (or after rounding 9 Mio USD), not less than 8 Mio USD...  It's easy to find their ETH address because of the nature of ETH. - If you check their token sale contract, you can read from the contract and find the 'ethFundDeposit' address '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5', which is a multi-signature wallet - At the time of the transparency report (end of july 2018) '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5' had a balance slightly above 10k ETH. This is near the claimed amount of 9.5k ETH mentioned in the transparency report. - On Aug 27, '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5' transferred 5.4k ETH to another multi-signature wallet at '0x847c590d780913b394290295a26ea172e12ffbf1', through transaction '0xa1a227497c108f6e8784c7c080789a9d6c45d29cfa4166c10058baab5c683250'. There was a discussion around this transfer at that time and the team confirmed it to be an internal transaction (and not as rumored, a payment for Binance) - At the time of the AmA (Jan 11) '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5' had a balance of 1k ETH and '0x847c590d780913b394290295a26ea172e12ffbf1' had a balance of 5.4k ETH, so a total of 6.4k ETH. This is also near the claimed amount of 6.5k ETH mentioned during the AmA.  I already did these checks when I first saw their claims and I bet others did as well. Everyone can verify all my findings easily through etherscan. Of course the fact that they were not lying about their ETH funds doesn't say anything about BTC/Fiat/RealEstate part of their funds, but at least proofs parts of the transparency report and AmA statement to be valid.  As mentioned before, I think the team should definitely improve on communication, transparency and marketing. It shouldn't be necessary for me to get these numbers and addresses from the blockchain. But, on the other hand, most other ICOs don't even do such transparency reports, so this is definitely better than many others...",neg

"   How is that a surprise for you? This was already mentioned in the AmA that they have 6500 ETH (1 Mio USD at that time). They also have 680 BTC (2.7 Mio USD) and 5.1 Mio. USD in Fiat. I don't think they are required to pay devs in ETH, they can also pay in BTC, USD or NIM, so they don't need to buy ETH to pay devs... In fact, given the low amount of transactions on the ETH wallet, I bet they don't normally pay team members with ETH. Also it was probably a very good idea to not have many ETH anymore, the price of ETH is now half of what it was during the ICO, so they saved a lot of money by selling their ETH to BTC and USD.

So, I can bet many of the numbers were increased.  They can always have more accounts than the one I found. I would expect them to transfer smaller funds from the multi-signature wallet to a single-signature wallet, so they can have easier access (UX for most multi-signature wallets just sucks).  Also I just rechecked my numbers, and they actually have more than 6500 ETH (my 6400 ETH was rounded down, so it was my fault, not theirs): 1,073.38518119 ETH (@ 0xEFa351D189c367D109859AFdF6f3D17EEb0825a5) + 5,457.0405 ETH (@ 0x847C590d780913B394290295A26EA172e12fFbF1) = 6530,42568119 ETH. Again this is a lower bound, they could easily have more than that. So it looks like they were actually not rounding up, but rounding down. Maybe they wanted to trick us into thinking they have less than they actually have.  The AmA was done on Jan 11, so you shouldn't take the whole 200k USD monthly burn rate, because this is only half a month ago, but only deduct something like 100k USD.  Also you are now taking today prices for BTC and ETH, so to be correct you should also evaluate the ICO funds accordingly: 60,000 ETH (which was what they got in the ICO) is 6,955,082.24 USD today. They still have 6500 ETH left, so they only invested 53,500 ETH, which is 6,202,149.78 USD today. From 6,202,149.78 USD they were able to diversify into 1.1 Mio. USD worth of real estate (not a villa, they said its empty land in the AmA), 5.1 Mio. USD in cash and 2,415,400.80 USD worth of BTC (680 BTC at current price). If we consider only the Cash and BTC as movable funds, they still managed to earn 1.3 Mio. USD (made 7.5 Mio. USD from 6.2 Mio. USD) beside buying the empty land and all compensations and payments. So if you take it that way, they actually performed very well and had a net positive first 1.5 years, to be precise it is +21%. (I am not really serious about this now, just saying that your calculation also doesn't make a lot of sense). Given that they already delivered way more than half of what they proposed during the ICO, even -50% would have been fine to me.  But I still don't know why they actually should lie at us around this numbers? Could you explain what they earn from putting wrong numbers out (which probably is illegal given they are a Swiss non-profit foundation)? I don't think these saying have any influence on the price of NIM and I also think they are not very interested in increasing the price of NIM (at least until now they did no marketing in that direction).  I totally understand that some investors (by the way, you are still pending to proof you actually are one) are upset about the price. I might be too if I hadn't earned more than I lost through clever trading (or luck) of NET and NIM. But fortunately for me, I am still net positive with my Nimiq investment and as such am not blinded for the progress they are doing (for example in scalability research or UX improvements).

"   You just accidentally confirmed a two very important things: - You use the name ""Mr. Glenn"", which is the name of a very active user in Nimiq community channels. You apparently knew his name, so you knew he was an active user of Nimiq before. The fact that he only has one post on this specific forum does not matter if you know that he was active on other platforms. You just try to discredit him, but actually know that what you say is very unlikely at least because your reasoning is nonsense. - You write ""We believe"", although no other account, and especially none of the other ~5 FUDer account posted yet and obviously never claimed that glenn_hodl is a sockpuppet account before, because there was no reason to (first post, as just pointed out by you). The only way for you to know the believe of the other ~5 FUDer accounts is that you coordinate through another channel *or* all FUDer accounts are owned by the same person.  Also I just wanted to point out again that neither you, nor any of the other ~5 FUDer accounts ever made any attempt to proof you were/are highly invested into Nimiq and had losses. Some of the accounts claimed they are going to sell their massive stack in short time without any substantial price movement thereafter, which makes it very unlikely that the claim is actually true. Until you provide any proof that you participated in the ICO or do own larger amounts of NIM (or NET) today, I suspect you are actually lying about your losses. So from now on, everytime you say you are writing here because of your massive losses due to your investment in Nimiq, I will point out again that you are a liar and a sockpuppet account of WebDollar (I have no proof for the latter, but you also have no proof for 90% of your claims, so I think it is totally fine for this forum if I am wrong with some of the things I write).",neu

"   And with ""Facts proved by bitcointalkers"" you probably meant ""Stories made up by those few FUDers on bitcointalk. 1. Robin announced that he was a drug addict more than half a year ago, but is sober since then. Your accusations only started in January (because you opened the account only then) so basically after or around when he made it public and way after he was already sober. Also it wasn't you to prove it, it was Robin himself announcing it (and to be precise, there is still no proof at all, just his announcement, that he apparently deleted by now). 2. There is no proof of any pending internal struggles over money. The team announced they were willing to give Robin money under certain conditions for independent research and he was not willing to fulfill this conditions. 3. According to latest report in AmA, the burn rate is around $200k/month right now. Even a $250k/month burn rate would not cause financial trouble due to their announced holdings of more than $8 Mio. 4. Team confirmed to run low volume market making bot, no fake volume bot. 5. No price manipulation was ever proven. In fact, ""attempts"" of proofs done by some FUDers on bitcointalk were easy to debunk and did not prove anything. 6. GPU mining is available. There are no details as to when first GPU miners existed. Nimiq Team never claimed that there are no GPU miners or that they are unlikely or hard to create. Still FUDers on bitcointalk did nothing that contributed to a proof on this topic 7. According to swiss company register, the foundation board consists of multiple non team members and not all team members are in the foundation board. Removing from the team is independent of removing from foundation board. 8. Just recently the partnership with agora trade and presumably a third party in the financial sector was announced to create the first-of-its-kind, non-custodial fiat exchange. See  9. Subjective, thus impossible to proof. 10/11. Even though some community projects were closed, others were started at the same time. Most of the community members that created projects they closed now, are still part of the community (ex. Blub, creator Beeppool, now closed, was still actively contributing in the Nimiq Discord these days and provided help with setting up a community seed node. He also still hosts one of the community seed nodes, actively contributing to the network).  TL;DR: Most of the ""facts"" are just lies, and none of them was proven by FUDers on bitcointalk, but actually only debunked or explained in detail by the team.

Short summary: Nimiq is aiming to provide easy and user-friendly crypto-payments with real decentralization, focusing on web payments (PayPal-like checkout) right now. This is accomplished by light clients that run directly in any browser (no installation or plugin required), but still are a fully decentralized client - no trusted third party involved as in other web wallets like Coinbase (custodial) or MyEtherWallet (non-custodial), browsers are directly connected to the peer-to-peer network.

"   Angry? No. Disappointed? Maybe. Unhappy? Also possible.

Many of your points a provably wrong - I was mostly active in Discord, not Telegram, so that is why you see little activity from me on Telegram. I only go to Telegram if people in Discord write about it. - My bitcointalk account is from December, ""Robin drama"" started in January. I indeed created my Reddit account lately to publish the survey there, but that was also before the ""Robin drama"". - My total number of posts is 56, not hundreds. You and the other sockpuppets indeed went in the hundreds in total. - I am not defendng team excessive salaries because I don't think they are excessive. The team stated that the highest salary (probably Robin or Philipp) is around $90/h with the average at $60/h. In my experience, that is not absurdly high in the IT field in general and according to studies found in the internet actually low for crypto currency industry. - The survey was not fake, in fact some of the respondents faked data (a few claimed to be from Telegram or Discord but in fact came from BitcoinTalk), but there is nothing to do against that. I can also share the insight that people that came from BitcoinTalk on average had a way worse opinion than people coming from any other source. You have no way to proof that the survey is fake, I can provide as much as you'd like to proof the survey is real. So if you can say why you think the survey is fake (beside that you don't like its result), please go ahead so that I can debunk your claim. - I think my knowledge of code is not very high. I know the details from a technical perspective, but I am neither JS nor Rust dev (I go with C/C++ instead) so I haven't looked to much in the code.  Funny thing is: You repeatedly asked for refund from the team, but refused to give any proof of being eligible for refund to me.

Because all publicly available information says otherwise. The highest salary as announced by the team is $90/h. Even that is less than $200k/year, and I doubt Marvin receives the highest salary in the team.  I can also make up lies and make them bold and red: Warning: coinfanatic is an insider, trying to trick investors into selling at all time low so he can profit more",neu
   Agree. You can find Robin Linus' leak here ,neu
"   You forgot to mention that $90/h is the maximum upon team members. Based on their monthly burn rate ($200k/month) we can estimate that the average of their 20 team member receives at most $10k/month (unlikely, because they also have other expenses then salaries). $10k/month at 40h/week is about $55/h or $120k/year - including benefits (because benefits are part of the burn rate). It makes no sense to use the maximum team member salary and use this for every team member. According to this article, the average blockchain dev salary is more than $150k/year. So the average dev at Nimiq earns less than the average overall blockchain dev. If all these numbers are true (and I have no reason to assume the opposite beside you claiming so), this means that there is no reason to complain about salaries, as they are in no way extraordinary.  Your link to proof they do not work applies filters, removing those filters will improve the image a lot. Also you don't know what happens behind the scenes. For example the team says they are working on a new consensus protocol and this was also confirmed by a third-party (Reto Trinkler, Forbes 30 under 30). As this research is not public (yet), you can't see it on GitHub. Also other work outside of GitHub is not visible in your link. I am actually way more excited about new stuff and partnerships then about them changing existing code.... Oh: ""merging commits of other developers"" is called code review. It is one of the most important aspects of developing a secure application and takes quiet some time, so it's not a minor work.",neu

"  You are intentionally referring to outdated information. In the AmA a month ago, they announced about $200k/month. They confirmed this number in a recent blog post: around $200k-$210k/month   Their website shows only 19 team members:  Most of them aren't ""blockchain devs"": 2 video guys, 1 chef, 1 girl for ""Communication"" and so on... There are only 4 ""Blockchain Core Developers"" on the website. Marvin is counting 20 to make up his story... Seems you are right this time and I miscounted the team members, although 19 vs 20 is not a huge difference anyway. Also I count a total of 10 developers on their team page, not 4. So you are saying that the other team members get about nothing? Do you have any proof for that? According to the recent blog post, compensation for team members ranges from $20 to $90 per hour. This range narrows to $50-$90 for the development team. Of course we don't know what exactly Marvin gets, but it seems to be between $50/hour and $90/hour. The team repeatedly said they don't want to publish per-person salaries, so we need to stick with what we got, but saying that Marvin gets more than $90/hour is definitely a lie from your side if any of the numbers provided by the team is true. We can also try to ask Marvin if he is on the upper or lower end of the $50 to $90 spectrum, if that is so important for you, he is always very open for chats on Discord.

So, for the sake of the argument, let's restrict his commits only to bitcoin core, by looking at -02-10&to=2019-02-09&type=c You can see that Wladimir actually had 65 commits to bitcoin core within the last year, Marco had the most with 222 commits.

They have two core implementations (in JS and Rust) in separate repositories, see the commit counts at -network/core/graphs/contributors?from=2018-02-10&to=2019-02-09&type=c and -rs/graphs/contributors?from=2018-02-10&to=2019-02-09&type=c You can see that Marvin had 85+31=116 commits to the core repos, Philipp was doing 175+58=233 commits, Pascal 151+149=300 commits. So all of them had more core commits then Wladimir and both Philipp and Pascal had more than Marco.  However, I won't say that the team or any of its developers did more or less than any bitcoin dev. This is because it is hard to rate the value of commits and the amount of work required to produce them. The fact that you tried to do this shows how few you understand about software development in general....

"   Sorry, looks like you have no clue what you are talking about. This talking about commits makes no sense, but still I am pretty sure your 10% number does not stand any thoughtful analysis.  bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org and bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org are static websites. No development involved, it's more like marketing and communication. In fact it even includes the blog. Just because Nimiq don't have their website and blog in a GitHub repository, doesn't mean it's not something they put work into. Also the communication hardly says anything about a ""blockchain core developer"", because developers are there to develop not to communicate.  I am happy to include Wladimirs commits to the other development repositories you mentioned as long as we also include Nimiq team commits outside the core: - bitcoin/bitcoin: Wladimir +65 - nimiq-network/core: Philipp +175, Pascal +151, Marvin +65 - nimiq/core-rs: Pascal +149, Philipp +61, Marvin +31 - ElementsProject/lightning: Wladimir +4 - vidbina/bitcoin.env: Wladimir +1 - laanwj/rust-bitcoin-rpc: Wladimir +0 (not sure why you brought this up at all) - laanwj/rust-clightning-rpc: Wladimir +60 - nimiq/accounts: Pascal +10, Marvin +3 - nimiq/keyguard-next: Philipp +11, Pascal +4, Marvin +3 - nimiq/vue-components: Marvin +8 TOTAL: Pascal 314, Philipp 247, Wladimir 130, Marvin 110  Summarized: Wladimir has about 20% more commits than Marvin, but doesn't beat Pascal and Philipp. So maybe the Team should consider firing Marvin.... But still your 10% number is totally off, it's more like 80%....  Even if we add Wladimirs commits to the websites, that only is an additional of 6 commits on bitcoincore.org and 8 commits on bitcoin.org. Adding those will change the number to maybe 75%, still far away from 10%.... And again I managed to prove your point invalid.

"  There is no conflict between what I said and what GitHub says. GitHub contributions are communication and commits. I never said otherwise. You failed to proof that bitcoin devs have significantly more commits. This concludes that the significantly higher number of contributions consist mainly of communication. Learn to apply basic logic.  Quote from: wentian.cn on February 10, 2019, 05:14:57 PM There are even open source projects that have more work committed. One example is the nimiq's biggest competitor, namely WebDollar. According to its github repository, WEBD devs had over  3,000+ commits in a year with no funding Thanks for confirming again where this FUD is coming from.  Quote from: Scamiq on February 10, 2019, 05:52:10 PM Ok fine it's a failed project. Now can we please have some accountability from the team!!!!!! In my opinion there are four possible situations an ICO project might be in: (1) The project failed. They are unable to produce what they intend to due to lack of funding. All the team can do is publicly announce and excuse for their failure. (2) The project failed. The team did not produce anything or only very few of what was announced during the ICO and stopped further development. (3) The project is in progress. The team is producing what is intended to be produced by the ICO investors. (4) The project is succesful. The team produced all the things the ICO investors wanted them to produce. There is no reason for refunds as the investors got what they paid for.  It's now up to you to decide which of the four best describes the current situation. (1) is not the case given the financial insights the team provided in their latest blog post (2) is invalid given they are still actively developing and also developed a fully functional blockchain completely from scratch and launched a mainnet, which is kind of the main thing they proposed to do with the ICO funds. So only (3) and (4) are possible options. Decide which one you prefer.

According to Robins public post on Jan 8, where he announced to have been cannabis addicted in the past, he also was ""sober for almost half a year now"" (Proof), so at the time of the posts you linked (Jan 4) he was already sober, so even if there was a team comment that he is not drug addicted, that would have been true at that time.  Moreover, the team announced Robin will work on research on or around beginning of September (Proof). At this time (4 month before his post) Robin was also already sober according his announcement. Additionally, Robin shared a prototypical implementation of his current research dated back to Aug 5 (Proof), so chances are good he was already sober at that date.

Now they have 7.9 million left (according to their reports using current prices and keeping burning rate).

In September they will do another financial report telling us they will have 5 million left. 3. In December they will have 3 million left. 4. In March next year project will shut down its network and call of bankruptcy. 5. Richy, Philipp, and Marvin will be happy cashing in at least 1 million dollars each  - Community funding is paid in NIM, thus not causing additional expenses on the USD/BTC/ETH side, as foundation also owns a stack of NIM.... - I bet marketing was included in the monthly burn rate (as it is obvious reoccurring costs) - At current burn rate of $200k/month, the next 6 month (until September) would cost them $1.2M. Even if we just add another $700k of additional costs (and I don't think this makes any sense at all), they would end up at $6M, not $5M. - If you add another 4 month to end of December, you'd need to deduct less than $1M (not $2M as you just did), so by end of December they would be at about $5M, not $3M. - Richy, Philipp, and Marvin earn less than $200k a year (we don't know exact numbers though). By end of December, their total income thus will be less than $500k (2.5 years of Nimiq existence), thus half of what you just proposed.

"   Hey rippar, I think you are risking your reputation by blindly agreeing to such wrong statements. Here are some facts regarding the claims:  - ""the project is an ICO scam"": very subjective, but if you check the original roadmap and plans by the team (at time of ICO), you will see they actually managed to realize many of it. Only the marketing efforts seem to be not very fruitful, resulting in low price (way below ICO price and actually below value of foundation holdings). To me a scam is someone that (intentionally) does something else with the money than what it was intended for, which IMO is not the case here.  - ""burning all that money to look legit for SEC"": The team is not US based and US investors were excluded from ICO, so why should they care about SEC at all?  - ""no progress for the last months"": The team is about to finish the Rust implementation, providing major performance benefits. The development effort is easily visible on -rs/commits/master. Additionally the team already teased some cooperation with a financial institution. I guess we'll here some more details or a full announcement on this soon....  - ""fight in the team. robin linus is a cannabis drug addict"": Robin Linus is no longer a team member (maybe because he became drug addict, I don't know), so this doesn't really matter. There might have been a fight before he left the team, but they tried to handle this internal as much as possible, which is the right thing IMO....  - ""digging not profitable"": According to some GPU miners, it's one of the most profitable coins out there right now. Check this comparison site filled with details for a single nVidia GTX 1080 as an example",neu

They acquired a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica from ICO Money 14. Multiple members of scamiq team have acquired multiple properties in Costa Rica,  Germany and other countries. 15. ICO period was done using for-profit company with no KYC for American citizens 16. ICO investors lost all their money.  12. Last time they reported on this (during the January AmA), they said that moderators (on reddit, discord and telegram) are not paid, can you proof that this actually changed? Also you might be referring to the Community Fund, which is helping community projects by granting them some NIM from the Foundation holdings. This is exactly what I expect them to do with the Foundation NIM, how is that not a good thing? 13. The 1.1 million dollar villa claim has already been debunked over a month ago and you are well aware of it. See this post by the team with the relevant details. 14. This is a claim that has no proof attached. Can you provide one? Also it doesn't really matter what team members do privately. And there is no information on that topic in their transparency report and the financial insights published just a month ago also do not contain any indicator in that direction.... 15. There was no KYC for american citizens. In fact there was no KYC during the ICO at all. But there also was a ban of american citizens (in the terms, using IP banning and specifically asking the user just that additional question). KYC was then performed later on. 16. Investors got all the NIM they initially bought. They might have sold them though. The price was 5x ICO price a year ago, so investors could have easily made good profit with their investment. Also the price is likely to raise again given the things the team already announced....  Your new ""facts"" are even further away from actual facts than last time.

As outlined in the transparency report, this investment was intended as and has proven itself to be a diversified store of value for Nimiq’s assets (bought with BTC when price was around approx. 9k USD), while also providing grounds for potential expansion.

Find this land development study (made and signed by an external environmental advisor from Costa Rica) with reference to the real extent of the property.  The team is very clear that their primary purpose to buy the land is diversification, with the option to build a campus in the future (this implies they did not build a campus yet). They wrote that they only built three platforms for tents and a multiuse rancho. They even shared a photo of one of those platforms with tent. The exact location does not matter, but if you are good in using Google Maps, you should be able to find it through the aerial photos that are part of the land development study they published.

"   If they buy coins on the market to fulfill their duties, then the increase in price is not artificial. This is called demand and according to the theory of a free market, an increased demand should also increase the price.  Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on February 26, 2019, 05:28:32 PM The entire project is a bad joke. They shouted and screamed that they created an Instagram account, while their gram has only 10 photos. WHAT A FAIL! A project with 12.9 million dollars ICO has 10 photos on instagram and 100 followers.  Well, if the instagram is just created (as you said), how should the have a lot of photos or a lot of followers?",neu
"   I wasn't the one to claim they bought NIM to fulfill their duties, it was john.btc aka robin.nimiq aka nimiqshitcoin. I was just pointing out that his reasoning is flawed and that what he said is an indicator for demand not for artificial price increase.  I can add another item to the list of their duties (beside the 40M NIM they apparently assigned to the independent community funding board): Their salaries. According to this blog post, 16% of their monthly payments are paid in NIM, that's about 30k USD worth of NIM every month. The foundation currently owns 20k USD worth of NIM through the vesting, so they obviously have other sources of NIM.  As long as we don't see the relevant transactions on the Nimiq blockchain, we won't find out what the source of funds is. I still think it is not relevant at all, if they have duties in NIM, there is no problem if they buy NIM to pay them, as it is totally underpriced right now. If they now get rid of all the foundation/team owned NIM within a few months, that would be stupid (and a good reason to criticize them), not the other way round.  My guess is the price increase is more due to ""insider trading"" (where insider is everyone active in the community).... They were teasing an announcement the last days through Telegram and Twitter, so some people might have decided to take the potentially last chance to buy cheap NIM....",neu
"   Well, they are not keeping the NIM, they are using it to pay their expenses. If their employees/partners accept NIM as a means of payment, how is that a bad thing? That's exactly what NIM is intended for. Ideally at some point of the future, it's not only 16% paid in NIM, but 100%. But 16% already shows that they are willing to receive their salary in NIM (which is basically the same as investing into NIM), so they actually believe in their own project, which is again a sign that it is not a scam. Nobody would knowingly invest into a scam and they would be the one to know if it was a scam....  Oh, did you notice how they already do this for months? No? Then this is a sign that the latest price jumps are not at all related to the team buying NIM, because they were able to hide it before (probably do OTC trades, as this is how you do large amounts).  You and the ""other"" FUDers trying to find something negative (""price manipulation"") in a thing that is actually positive (""team buying NIM to fulfill their demand"") is wimpy.   You raised your point that Nimiq will probably be bankrupt within a few months and the value of NIM will go to zero similarly fast. So why don't you come back in a few months to tell us how you knew it in advance and what a genius you are. Or (which is way more likely) don't come back as you realize how wrong you were and that this project is actually perfectly legit and even positive for their investors at some point....  Analyzing your possible situations: 1. You believe in the project and think it is going to raise in value. You should continue HODL your NIM or even accumulate more at the current low price. You should not spread FUD as this would hurt your own investment. 2. You don't believe in the project anymore and think the value is going further down. You should have sold your bag already would no longer be invested into NIM (so can't claim to be highly invested without lying to deceive other investors). You might waste your time into FUDing, but that wouldn't give you anything valuable, so it's unlikely you'll do it every day for a month already. 3. You are invested into another project and think that hurting Nimiq by spreading FUD will increase the value of the your investment. You can't claim to be highly invested into NIM without lying to deceive other investors. 4. You are a paid shill of another project that wants to hurt Nimiq by spreading FUD. You might be invested into NIM, but your shill payment must be higher than your investments value to make it valuable for you to shill against your investment, so you can't claim to be highly invested into NIM without lying to deceive other investors. 5. You are just insane and have a lot of time to waste on the internet. You might be highly invested into NIM and still spread FUD. 6. You are just insane and after losing money by buying at ATH and selling at ATL, you now also want to lose your time spreading FUD (because time is money, so you can even lose more money on NIM). You can't claim to be highly invested into NIM without lying to deceive other investors. 7. You are Robin and are insane because you smoke too much. You just want to destroy the project at any cost and after you realized you are not going to be able to get the money from the team, you do so by spreading FUD.  It's easy to see that the first case does not apply to you and the other FUDers, as you are spreading FUD. In cases 2, 3, 4 and 6, you'd be a liar (as you claimed to be highly invested into NIM), in case 5 and 6 (and 7) you'd be insane. Which case matches yours?

"   Wrong! Buying your own company shares is not price manipulation. It is called share repurchase or stock buyback and something totally usual in stock markets. Here is the definition of price manipulation from wikipedia including several examples. Again, stock buybacks is not on their list.  Oh and you know, NIM is not the company share of Nimiq Foundation. NIM is a currency and there is no relation between the price of NIM and the value of Nimiq Foundation. That is the same as if you claim that BoA does price manipulation when they use some of their USD to buy EUR to pay their employees in their eu branch, who for some reason prefer EUR over USD.

"   It is your opinion that the coins are worthless, but the people that accept NIM as a means of payment probably have a different opinion and we are talking about those NIM. The demand is not from the Nimiq Foundation, but from their contractors and employees that get 16% of their payment in NIM.  Again, this is not price manipulation, at least not by any popular definition. Learn to use the right financial terms. This is contractors and employees of Nimiq Foundation demanding NIM, because they see a value in it. You can say they are stupid because they see a value in a coin you consider worthless, but that's something completely different.

New Announcement  Team Nimiq is thrilled to announce that we are working on a Crypto-Fiat bridge in collaboration with German WEG Bank AG and Swiss-Maltese non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange Agora.Trade! Learn more here   ,neu
"   The only problem in your argumentation is that according to their announcement it is the complete opposite of what you said:  One of the beauties of the solution is, that it works without issuing or acting through a stablecoin, by enabling the Euro directly to behave as if it was a token on a blockchain. and the counterparty could now be a Euro account holder, without a single, centralized intermediary ever controlling the two assets that are being exchanged.  This means: You don't invest into it, they just make your normal bank account more powerful by connecting it directly to blockchains. They don't sell a token and you don't give your money in the pocket of someone else, so nobody can scam you.  They basically tricked you with this: You can't claim they are scamming you because it is completely non-custodial and you don't invest into it.",neu
"New Article by Market Insider  Nimiq's novel approach makes fiat behave as if it were a token on a blockchain, meaning a crypto holder can sell their coins directly to a fiat bank account holder and vice versa. The transfer is done without a single, centralized intermediary (like an exchange or payment processor) controlling the two assets being exchanged, and without the private keys of the crypto asset ever being entrusted to a third party.

Do you have any proof for your claims?  To me it looks like WEG Bank is a private bank, focusing on homeowner associations (or something like that). I found this random forum thread in the internet where at least 2 people claim to have an account at WEG Bank.

So in Albatros it's actually not 51%, but 34%, because the security assumption is that at most one third (of selected block producers) is Byzantine. Haven't heard that, can you provide a proof that 51% is 34%? There is no 51% attack, that's just a stupid saying from PoW chains. What usually is meant by 51% attack is double-spend attack or selfish mining attacks. For those attacks, attackers on PoW chains need about 51% of mining power (well, you can do with less than 51%, but then you need luck). As far as I understood, PBFT needs 67% for double-spend, no? And selfish mining is not an issue in Albatross as there is no mining at all. From what I understood, the thing you can do with 34% in PBFT is to halt the protocol. This attack will cause your 34% stake to become worth nothing and can be resolved by all other stakers through a collaborative fork. So the effect is limited and you don't earn anything from it (= no incentive to perform), definitely not comparable to a 51% attack on PoW chains.

Thanks for confirming that you actually didn't invest $100k, which you said before. Another lie debunked. There was no way to invest $100k into NET, as the only currency supported during the ICO was ETH. So it doesn't really make sense to argue what the price is relative to USD. You also don't compare the price of NIM to Tesla shares or Transylvanian housing prices.  Even if your previous numbers were correct and we decide to compare the value of Nimiq to USD, your $3k calculation is still wrong: $100k with 1 NIM @ $0.01542 (*) = ~6.5M NIM $7k with 1 NIM @ $0.001130 = ~6.5M NIM (*) your number, and wrong as pointed out above Thus, even with your made up numbers, you would only be -93%.

"   Feels like groundhog day....  Within those two weeks, BTC went down by 15% and ETH by 25%. As they have a stash of crypto (which they detail out in the screenshot you presented), it is obvious they were affected by these price changes. They didn't ""burn"" it. I wouldn't be surprised if their holdings are higher now than Jan 24 as the prices went up again. Crypto assets are volatile....  Why are you so obsessed with their assets? Sure they lost a bit because they didn't liquidate all their crypto to fiat, but on the other hand, you also criticize their real estate asset which performed way better than the crypto assets. So basically you are saying: It's bad that they kept crypto (because it is volatile and lost a lot of value) and it's bad that they diversified (because you cannot easily verify it in the fiat world). This all doesn't really matter though. They presented clear numbers that say that they will be funded for at least another two years to come. It's only you who continues to claim they don't.

Also he presented a lot of wrong numbers and I bet if he really invested $100k he would track his investment properly (price is down by about 93% since ICO not 98%). It's highly unlikely that a person was able to invest $100k and still waste such an amount of time on writing posts on BitcoinTalk that nobody believes in anymore.

Agora.trade doesn't support Nimiq at the moment, although it was announced back in November this. It is only an idea to make an ICO.

"    As usual these are all lies.  1. There is no Trading Bot being used. As we answered in our AMA: ""We did provide funds for market making on HitBTC in an initial test phase through a partner."" This was when Nimiq was listed in HitBTC, September last year. Don't see how this is relevant more than half a year later. 2. That is not true, Nimiq has not bought any NIM to fund projects recently. So far only one project has received the funding they requested. That project is GetNIM, they were funded for 1 Million NIM. All information from Community Funding Board is published publicly in Nimiq's Blog. 3. That is also not true, the project doesn't buy a monthly fixed amount of NIM. We did confirm that Team Nimiq received part of their salaries in NIM which is something that you would expect from a cryptocurrency project. 4. No, that value is made up. Yes, Nimiq recently announced the project has acquired 9.9% WEG Bank. There was no mention of the amount in the announcent. However we did confirm Nimiq did not payed in NIM. Why acquire part of a crypto project would acquire stake in a Bank?: As a result of this partnership and acquisition, Nimiq OASIS will be able to leverage the SEPA Instant banking network through WEG Bank. This means that the combination of Nimiq OASIS, Agora.Trade and WEG Bank could enable customers at any of the 2,000+ banks in the SEPA Instant network to exchange value between crypto and fiat systems. The SEPA Instant network currently connects the majority of EU countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 5. No, this is not true. This value is just another assumption without any real information.

"    Seems like you are talking about another project    1- This is the GUI wallet:  . Nimiq is Browser-first and thus we provide a zero-installation 'just works' wallet. 2- Some small exchanges have contacted us. We are indeed interested in getting NIM listed in bigger more mature exchanges. Keep in mind what we answered in our AMA: ""Team Nimiq has been carefully weighing additional exchange listings, the cost of which can be exorbitant. The timing of pursuing such decisions is also determined by project development. If Nimiq were to simply add more exchanges without increasing the penetration of NIM then this could spread the total volume over more platforms which is not advantageous to stakeholders. Instead, the team will pursue additional exchange listings when it is believed that value will be created for Nimiq and the community.""

"   interesting... i knew you guys had the safe, but i admit i just saw it as another webwallet i had some coins from way back that i just remember having a shit of a time trying to download and use your cmdline wallet THEN i put coins in ""nimiq.app"" or w.e that was but they shut down stating no team support or something?  so now i been back using the cmdline wallet can i just dump the keys from there and reimport them into the safe?  i think ill give Nimiq another look thx for the quick response",neu
   I am using safe without any issues for a long time already.,neu
"   It is not just another web wallet. Nimiq is browser first so the safe is client-side and non-custodial (Like MEW) but the difference is that the Nimiq safe runs a Node in your browser that actually reaches consensus with the network (with MEW you need to use their node or run one in a server). Think of it like Encarta/Wikipedia or Office/Office360.  In terms of other wallets: if you want to use a hardware wallet we support Nano S. If you want to use a mobile app Nimiq is supported by TrustWallet (the official wallet of Binance).  There is even a tutorial of how to code your own wallet in the developer center if you want to learn more about it  In terms of progress, we have a new version of the safe being tested and will be released soon. You can try it out here: TESTING ONLY. DON'T USE REAL NIM",neu

   Answer this: why did you claim to lose $100k on this project when you initially said you only invested $50k?,neu
"     You forgot, he even bought xeon in order to ""dig"" Nimiq ",neu
   Thanks!  May I suggest a more recent article? Maybe -network/research-collaboration-albatross-63599386a7c9 or -network/nimiq-makes-fiat-currencies-blockchain-compatible-7503096a6252,neu
"    So your entire complain is: ""I started mining and bought mining equipment. Then community developers implemented a GPU miner and I didn't like that""  1- Aren't community developers implementing GPU miners a demonstration of interest from skilled developers and an obvious proof of the community supporting Nimiq? 2- Where did you get that Nimiq is a ""cpu only coin""?",neu
"    There is a problem in your logic. You say ""It means"" where is just an assumptions. Then you talk about development done by community developers which is obviously not under control of the project itself.  Have you seen any official blog posts that talk about a CPU only coin?",neu
    You keep SPAMMING and making non-factual claims. Robin Linus has not been considered a part of Team Nimiq for over 4 months now. That is not related to this project.,neu
"  They already have yearly transparency reports. Name any other crypto currency organization which goes so far to publish financial details. I don't know any, no matter how large or small they are. So why should Nimiq Foundation improve here when they already take a prime spot? I guess your expectation are a bit off to ask them for more transparency, given that they already are more transparent than most other in our field.   2. Clarifications on questions like Cannabis Usage / Addiction What exactly is your question? Who in the team has which medication schedule? In most countries in the world, discrimination based on medical conditions is illegal and details on medical conditions are private data protected by law. Are you asking them to do something illegal?   3. Why did they hide the Robin Linus cannabis addiction lying the entire community? Show me when they lied about addiction. Also I think drug addiction of employees or any person in general should never be made public if the person agrees to get proper treatment (which apparently happened in this case).   4. Why top 3 Developers who are paid with over 100,000 USD per year didn't work in the last 3 months. Developer salaries are not public information, so you actually can't know them. Also the details what they are working on are not public information, so you also can't say they are not working....   5. Price manipulation and trading bots. Before Robin officially asked them, they always lied telling us: ""NO"". After Robin Linus asked them, they answered yes without any details. They said they don't do price manipulation and don't run trading bots. They said they did provide funds for market making on HitBTC in an initial test phase through a partner. How is that a lie? How is that not detailed information?",neu
"   Robin has not been considered part of Team Nimiq as was announced more than three months ago and is no longer part of any decision making process of Team Nimiq.

Scrollbar is scrolled all up, but we are missing the top bar and search bar of the GitHub website which would be visible when scrolled all up. 5.

We cannot see the window title (why?) but you can see that it is way longer than the tab title (which is what would be displayed in the window title). 7. The font in the URL bar is way smaller than the one in the search bar. I guess you reduced size so that the full URL matches in the URL bar, but normal browsers won't do that.  tl;dr: You screenshot is provably a fake.

If the same account posts twice in a row under 24 hours (back to back comments), use the ""Report to moderator"" button at the bottom of their post and type ""double-posting in under 24 hours.""  I think the rules are a bit broken by design here: 1) It is not forbidden to own multiple accounts 2) It is only forbidden to double-post with the same account. Thus, the rule that forbids double-post is basically superfluous as it is allowed to bypass it using an alt account or any kind of collaboration between two or more accounts.",neu

"   The tweet doesn't mention Nimiq at all, so again you are only speculating that the increase in equity is anyhow related to Nimiqs investment. Rather unlikely, as an increase in capital is usually due to operational needs of WEG Bank. Your claim that they have 0 customers can easily proven invalid as its public knowledge that Lisk project has a bank account with WEG Bank.  Let's just wait for the next transparency report to get the details of the deal from Nimiq directly instead of relying on your obviously invalid claims.",neu
"   The logic is simple. The scammer Matthias von Hauff stated that in Q4 2018, TokenPay (another proved scam) went from 9.9% shares down to 7.5% after ""somebody"" invested 2 million euro. If nimiq was a different investor than ""somebody"" token pay would have been diluted again to a smaller percentage (5%). Which, in fact it didn't happen. Recently, TokenPay made an investment again to increase their dilution from 7.5% back to 9.9%.",neu
"   No that's just not how it works. When you buy stocks of a bank you are investing into the bank and get shares, but you are not increasing the equity. The money goes to the previous owner of the shares, not the banks equity. This was actually explained by Matthias himself in another tweet:   In most countries it is required for a bank to fulfill a certain equity ratio. Thus, banks need to increase equity to serve more customers. This is completely unrelated to investments....",neu
"   You are totally wrong. If no new shares (new equity) was created when nimiq acquired 9.9% stack in the scammy WEG Bank then, why did the token pay share was DILUTED to 7.5%?? Your answer doesn't make any kind of sense. Simple, because nimiq acquired 9.9% of the company and WEG bank just inflated its own shares diluting all existing stakeholders allowing nimiq to acquire these new shares from the bank itself.",neu
"   Seems like you haven't been following Nimiq project at all.   So what is going to happen with the unactivated NIM?  NIM that has not been activated will remain untouched for an amount of time to ensure that possible disputes of NET holders can be resolved. The amount of time is yet to be decided by the legal counsel. In any case, remaining NIM would exclusively be committed to supporting the Nimiq project and when it comes to such decision it will transparently be shared with the community. The Nimiq Foundation is bound by its purpose to use funds to support the Nimiq protocol development, Nimiq Ecosystem, and its community. For special inquiries re NET (only!) contact: netinquiry @ nimiq.com.  Details -network/and-then-there-was-only-nim-962f43a53aad",neu
"   No, You are obviously wrong and this is because your math doesn't even add up (and again, everyone can verify): As TokenPays share of 9.9% was dilluted to 7.5%, this means that the total amount of shares was increased by about 25% (= 1-7.5/9.9), but Nimiq only bough 9.9%. Thus the action that diluted the shares was not Nimiqs investment. You also claim that WEG Bank inflated its shares which is not true either. WEG Bank increased their equity from 6.5M EUR to 8.58M EUR on Dec 21, 2018. The decision to do so (according to record in german company register) happened on their general assembly on Nov 13, 2018. As far as we know from Nimiq, they first met WEG Bank CEO during their hackathon end of November, thus the increase in equity was planned before Nimiq and WEG Bank CEO met first. Also I doubt that Nimiq was owning the shares early January as they didn't mention anything related during their AmA when they gave details on their assets. In the blog post on Jan 24 they also did not mention the shares, but wrote that ""Nimiq holds approximately $9.1 million in total assets from original ETH contributions (diversified and held in crypto, fiat, and the campus property)"", which implies they didn't own any company shares at that point (or these shares were on top of the $9.1M, which is unlikely IMO). My best guess is that they developed Nimiq OASIS and only acquired the shares afterwards, maybe even as a compensation for developing the OASIS protocol (they never wrote they bought, they only wrote acquired).  Long story short: You are trying to connect two things that are completely unrelated. The WEG Bank increased their equity to serve more customers on Nov 12, 2018, diluting the shares of TokenPay. Nimiq bought shares of WEG Bank at some point after Jan 24, 2019.  You have a record of provably invalid claims and lies using your multiple fake accounts. You never contributed anything of value to this thread.   Quote from: Scamiq on May 20, 2019, 08:51:44 AM WEG bank still? I thought it's Agora bank soon.

"   Exactly, running a pic/nano node. Thanks for the addition dear friend.  Nano Nodes Nano Nodes are the preferred node type for Browser Clients, since they require less data to be downloaded (~ 2MB) in order to establish consensus.  Similar to light nodes, they determine the current state of the blockchain using NIPoPoW, but then only download block headers and the minimal amount of information related to its own accounts. Once the correct state has been worked out, i.e. consensus established, account balances can be cryptographically proven to this type of node.  Pico Nodes Similar to the Nano Node, the Pico Node uses the Accounts Tree and account proofs. But instead of syncing block headers using NiPoPoW, it will first test if all its peers are on the same head hash (or a neighboring hash) and, if that is the case, it will accept that head as the correct one. This is also referred to as an optimistic approach. Only if it receives incompatible head hashes will it fall back on the nano consensus.  The pico consensus is the latest development and is expected to replace the nano consensus as new default as soon as it’s fully established.",neu

Each Nimiq Identicon has five different elements, bottoms, faces, sides, tops body, and background color. Each element has a distinctive color. In total, identicons are made up of a combination of:  21 bottoms 21 faces 21 sides 21 tops 8 colors for parts 9 body colors 10 background colors  That means there are 10 * 9 * 8 * 21⁴ = 140,026,320 different identicons that can be generated, so Nimiq is capable of generating more than 100 million highly differentiated and instantly recognizable identicons. This protect users against malware and clipboard hijacking.  If a Nimiq user is subject to a clipboard hijacking attack and the malware replaces the Nimiq address on the clipboard with an account address controlled by the attacker, then the user will paste this fraudulent address into the send field and the receiving addresses identicon will be shown instantly. If you are sending NIM to a friend and you see an identicon different from their usual one, then you instantly know that someone has launched a clipboard hijacking attack against you.

According to you, this is the vulnerability.  1- Hacker has to guess who I am going to send NIM to. Nimiq Identicon Protection   2- Hacker tries to find an identicon that looks the same as the recipient he had to guess before. And hopes that's the one recipient I actually use. Nimiq Identicon Protection   3- Hacker infects my device with clipboard hijacking. All cryptocurrencies are vulnerable 4- Hacker executes clipboard hijacking and hopes I don't check the address. All cryptocurrencies are vulnerable   When compared to other cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), Nimiq provide steps from 1 and 2 as an extra layer of protection without adding complexity to the user.

In January these group of users were created with the sole purpose of spreading FUD in this thread:  nimiqshitcoin, coinfanatic, andrewjaxx, john.btc, sasha.new, Scamiq, Scamiq2, matthewgpu  As you might have noticed they always use unnecessarily aggressive language, huge red bold fonts and empty claims instead of serious questions.  Team Nimiq have answered here their non-factual claims. Also held a live Reddit AMA session recently where all questions were answered. There is also a blog post with a  summary of the AMA.  Nimiq welcome all newcomers, invite them to ask questions, and would like to apologize for these users behavior and any inconvenience they might cause.",pos

"Why isn't this thread self-moderated? The trolls keep the thread bumped, but it's a waste of our time reading all the back-and-forth between devs and trolls. Many coins with this problem have started self-moderated threads. Honestly, the trolling and responses make the project look bad, not good. If the project needs trolls to keep the thread bumped, there's something wrong with this setup.",neu
"   I guess everyone that is interested in a serious conversation about Nimiq stopped using BitcoinTalk and moved over to their other communication channels (Telegram, Discord). The trolls had too much room and apparently forum moderators didn't consider that excessive trolling a problem (only some posts were deleted and the users not banned). I also can understand that the Nimiq Team doesn't want to go self-moderated.   1) It will support the trolls claim of being censored,   2) looking at how aggressive these trolls are, moderating a thread could become a full-time job without the forum moderators banning the trolls and should forum moderators decide to ban the trolls, the thread would work fine without being self-moderated again....  IMHO, forum moderation/administration team failed to see the need to act here and thus rendered the thread and its forum unusable for serious conversation, which (again IMO) is exactly what they should aim for, to allow the forum to be used for serious conversation without unnecessary distraction.",neu

Test both and see which works better for you:  Mat's Sushiminer (No Dev fee):  -miner-cuda/releases EhssanD's Noncerpro (Dev fee): -nimiq-cuda/releases    So, about pools... Here's a list of them:    I would highly recommend mining on Nimpool.io (1%).  Icemining.ca (1.5%) is great, but it currently has 3/4 of the hash and that needs to be distributed.   There's siriuspool.net (1%) and nimiq.watch (1%) as well, but they don't have many miners, and it would be nice if people started using these as well.   Skypool's fee is uknown and Sushipool  (5%-10% GPU fee) seems to be having technical issues in these past few weeks.  I don't even know if their pool is up cause it's still displaying yesterday's stats.",neu

Good day. Data leakage is a big  ads market problem. How are you going to deal with it?,neu
Hey everybody. Does anyone know what developers are going to use to prevent data leakage on MAD Network? ,neu
Hello. I dont really understand what server MAD is for. I know that it creates transparency between publishers and advertisers but modern industry works just fine with out it.,neu
"  Yes, you are right. Transparency is just one of MAD ideas. But the main focus is to let publishers and advertisers work together without a middleman as a traditional necessary part of the ads market.",neu
  Why would you work without a middleman since he makes certain things easier?,neu
Good Day. Does anyone know how make tokens were produced by MAD developers?,neu
"  As a matter of fact, advertisers and publishers are able to work rather successfully without a middleman that just makes advertising campaign more expensive and obviously decreases publishers' income.",neu
  Well.. Do you know what commission does a middleman get?,neu
  Sometimes it gets up to 60% of advertising budget. So a publisher gets only $0.4 for every $1 spent by an advertiser. The rest is for middleman's commission. Can you imagine all those opportunities for advertising campaign if publisher could use this money?   ,neu
  Wow that's impressive. In fact middleman doesnt do much in this partnership. Do you think it is not going to damage the quality of the service provided? In the market?,neu
Can anyone explain to me why data leakage is so bad for advertising market? It kinda males targeting easier.,neu

"  Wait, what? Where did you get it from? MAD Network advertisers can use fiat money to pay publishers?!",neu
   I’m not sure where exactly I’ve seen it. I guess in some blog. Probably the same one I learnt about this project from.,neu
  Well… Just want to inform you that advertisers cant use fiat money to pay for anything in this platform.,neu
On website airdrop of 50 MAD token if you register. Mmm.. only few comments for this project. It seems the idea is not catching up.,neu
"   It turns out that only cryptocurrencies can be used in the platform, right?  ",neu
   I’m pretty sure that you can use only MAD coins for all the transactions. There are also gonna be MADbonus that are to be used to reward most active users.,neu
Hello. Do you think that service provided to advertiser will be still high quality job if theres no middleman control?,neu
Greetings everyone. What is the difference between MAD and MADcred coins? Can they be used for all the transactions withing the platform or there are any restrictions?,neu
Hello. How much are planning to get during ICO? Founders have already some idea?,neu
Hey everyone. When does MAD coin sale start?,neu
  Well founder would consider 25 million USD as a quite a good result.,neu
Hello. Is there any particular reason for transaction and MADcred accounts transparency?,neu
  Good evening. MAD sale starts on Dec. 15.,neu
In the project description it’s said that less and less MADbonus will be issued. Does it mean that eventually Madbonus program will be over,neu

How much does one mad-token cost? With what currency can I buy it?,neu
"Hello! I'm not very good at all these technologies, but I'm interested in the project. How will participants be able to interact?",neu
"   Greetings! The core of the system is the MADnet advertising server, it was created for the purchase and sale of advertisements that should be as accurate as possible for advertisers. Search and selection will be carried out as quickly and as correctly as possible.",neu
"   Well, does it turn out that it’ll be a kind of exchange for advertisers and manufacturers?",neu
   Quite right. The most correct execution of requests of all participants will take place on this exchange. And this is only one of all the advantages.,neu
   And how will the order process itself be occurred in the system in general terms?,neu
   The advertiser creates an application using MAD-tokens. The information enters the core of the platform and gets analyzed. The optimal match is selected. Then there is a smart contract is created.,neu
"Mad-greetings to everybody!) Will there be any restrictions on the operation of the network? I mean, on time or on requirements to the participants?",neu
I recently watched a TV shoe dedicated to a similar topic ... The advertising market on the Internet was estimated by billions of contracts a year in the show. This is the number of transactions. How many transactions can this startup process?,neu

Marketing and advertising industry is huge market that's why many new startups working on this field. What's your difference to compete with another one?,neu
"Hello! I’ve read that monetization can be customizable and changeable in the platform. By what rules will this be introduced? How will it be regulated? Such a problem and a problem of fair monetization are very common. As for me, I’ve encountered it on Youtube.",neu
"  Greetings! You’re right - this is a very important and relevant issue for content creators. There’re a lot of questions about monetization programs. Prerequisites are the following: different campaigns on different platforms, different support for content creators. All in all, we can say that this market is still quite new and simply isn’t “ripe” yet.",neu
"  One can say it isn’t “ripe”, but one can also say that there’s no regulation and each platform performs it in its own way, basing on some their rules. One famous platform blocked my videos several times on the first day after the release (when there’s the maximum number of views). Then, after my appeal, I was unblocked just like nothing happened. Of course, I’ve already lost some of the views and profits. Will MAD create a platform that is fair in this regard?",neu
"  Your example can be called classic, many content makers have suffered from it.  Introducing a fair approach in this start-up to this issue is one of the managers’ tasks. Moreover, solving such problems directly affects loyalty. The goal in this part of the work is to create a convenient and fair monetization system.",neu
"  Good! Apparently, there won’t be any problems with transparency, too?",neu
  Certainly! A united platform combined with the advantages of blockchain technology provides all stakeholders with transparency of the system.,neu
  This is a great advantage and a keystone to loyalty in this case. How does the service plan to capture the market?,neu
"We are on the threshold of the ICO, the 14th of December 14 is “around the corner”, but there’re almost no details! When will the date be announced?",neu

Hello! How is it planned to distribute the tokens? I’ve heard that a team of managers and advisers plans to get a sweet piece immediately!,neu
"As I see, the project still needs to be developed. Especially they should work on such an advanced platform. How much funds will be allocated to its development?",neu
What total amount of tokens will be issued? For all directions.,neu
   Greetings! We’ve only heard about 220 million units yet. I guess I’ve read in WP.,neu
I see that we are on the threshold of launching the system. I have already invested my “penny”.  Can I take part in testing the platform?,neu
Do I understand correctly that as a content maker I’ll be able to see how advertisers use it and how I get profit in real time?,neu
How long ICO will run dev?,neu
I got acquainted with the WP. It seemed to me that there’s nothing unique in MAD data. Just a usual chain. Am I mistaken?,neu
"If I want to watch the project first and perhaps join it by buying tokens later than ICO, how can I do it?",neu
"Something that I don’t understand completely is the following: will there be one ad network? Or will there be several specialized ones, but on the same platform?",neu
  Such conservative and cautious investors as you are likely to get an opportunity to buy tokens and on the stock exchanges also.,neu
The launch of the token is scheduled for December 14. And when will ICO start?,neu
"   Unfortunately, there’s no information yet. But as for me, I'm sure that soon it will be revealed)",neu
"the thread created on november 8, 2017 and its almost one month now, but there is no updates from this project,,",neu
Hi everybody! Is MADnet going to struggle against intermediaries between advertisers and developers? Are intermediaries really so bad and harmful for business?,neu
"  No one says they’re harmful and no one going to struggle against them. However, you are unlikely to deny the fact that in general the mediator doesn’t create anything, but instead “clings” to a profitable stream of money.",neu
"  But that’s not a fact! Intermediaries often greatly contribute to the spread of an industry, simply earning on the performing some small operations, which the creator or the client have no time to do.",neu
"  I can agree with you in part. But I’ve heard somewhere that intermediaries in this project’s industry collect up to 60% of the final price. Perhaps, there should be some limits!",neu
"  Hmm! If these data is real, of course it’s significant. Especially if you imagine that the final service might be cheaper for me these 60%, for example!)",neu
"  That’s what I’m talking about?! But modern organization principles, centralization and restrictions don’t allow you to limit the costs of intermediaries. The principles of this project will make it easier for clients and manufacturers to “have a sigh”, and simply “take down a peg” the intermediaries.",neu
"Look, are there examples of how much cheaper advertising becomes in the long run? Or some other assessments of the economic effects of the project?",neu
"Hello. I don’t understand it-terms, but my mate advised me to look at this project. Explain me please, what parts does the system consist of?",neu
"   MADnet Books, MADnetCore, MADnetData. Hello. Together all these parts become a system based on blockchain trchnology. Did you understood purpose of each element?",neu
"  You ve anticipated my question! Of course I d like to read about them in plain words. S for blockchain, I ve been hearing about its advantages.",neu
"   MADnet Books allows users to place the orders, opens a platform already tokenized for trading and exchanging advertisements.",neu
"  TSo that’s anything like an in-put registry? Then there should be the central part processing incoming requests and searching for matches, as far as I understand, am I right?",neu
"   Yes, it’s performed by MADnetCore. In addition to query mappings, this part checks the available content for authenticity ranks and performs directly the interaction functions of different incoming requests.",neu
"  Ok. I’ve got only one question concerning MADnetData. Judging by its name, this part stores data. What is peer-to-peer structure? Does it give any advantages?",neu
"My question is an original one) I have a small advertising agency. Can I invest its part? Well, change it for tokens of the ICO. And then can I be among the first to start working on this network?",neu
"  Super question, I join him. It’s a very interesting option. Hey, managers! Don’t ignore us.",neu
Provide me with information on benefits of participating in the ICO and pre-ICO ... How can I learn about bonuses?,neu
"  All investors who have invested at the early stages usually receive bonuses and discounts, as well as privileges.",neu
I’ve invested in it; I see understandable prospects and mechanisms of work. I want to specify: what will the funds received during the project be allocated to? When do you plan to begin to make profit?,neu
I’ve heard about the cool technology that is used in the startup. And how will the network be protected from freeloaders and scammers who will try to get there for sure?,neu

 Does anyone know detailed information about proof-of-real-work algorithm?  I just want to figure out what exactly it is and why is it so unique. egretia,neu
"   Proof of Real Work powers the ad server to facilitate the fairest deal possible between the advertiser and publisher as the algorithm is not invested in its own profitability. Rather, the ad server supports an ecosystem of miners who are incentivized to create faster, more efficient machine learning algorithms to win the block.  MADnet Core is the ad server designed to execute buying and selling of advertising. MADnet Core will be powered by our proof-of-real-work algorithm, which combs through ad requests and campaigns to find fast feasible matches, maximizing throughput simultaneously ensuring campaigns deliver and inventory gets monetized. Feasible matches are defined as pairings of individual ad requests to campaigns that meet all publisher and advertiser rules including real time restrictions such as frequency caps and industry separation.

If you are in the SF area and wish to attend, please use our discount code: SPK8xa8tvotSF18.    Is A Token Economy the Answer to Ad-Tech’s Woes?  Blockchain can offer a great deal of value to the ad industry without tokenization, but it is the token that really brings that potential to the next level. Tokens represent an intent to do a deal, and they represent value within the marketplace. By staking tokens into a “smart contract” and codifying the deal, both the buyer and the seller benefit. A token economy could flip the market dynamics for the middle layer, making it more profitable to actually serve the interest of buyers and sellers, which is not always the case today. Commodifying the layers in the middle will shift the fee structure from a percentage media spend to a flat fee pricing system. For the buyer, this results in greater reach for the cost, while publishers actually lower the margin compression which currently plagues the digital advertising ecosystem. The buyer gets to understand exactly how much budget they have left to spend in any given quarter, while the seller gets paid faster.

The quotes we really like:  “Blockchain has a problem: It’s long on potential, short on immediate utility. The story is no different in media, where blockchain’s boosters preach it will solve everything from consumer privacy issues to viewability problems to cleaning up the media supply chain to even vetting influencer contracts.”   “A lot of the solutions we’re seeing in ad tech is like taking a mechanical clock and slapping a radio on top of it, and calling it a digital clock,” says Adam Helfgott, CEO of the Mad Network, which is attempting to use blockchain to fix ad tech and cut out middlemen.”  -blockchain-distributed-ledger-hot-use-advertising-remains-question-mark/",neu

"Hello MAD Community - here’s our update for this week (June 27):     Cannes Lions 2018: Huge Success!  As you know, the team was at the Cannes Lions Festival last week - and it was a huge success.  Following our panel with WPP & Omnicom, the team met with key media executives from top companies including Disney, CBS, Fox, Denstu, Havas, and American Express (among many others) to discuss the MAD protocol and how they can get involved. Developing meaningful relationships with the biggest companies in the world like CBS and Fox, and advertising holding companies like Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Dentsu & Havas is vital to our success! And we’re proud to say we walked away from Cannes with tons of support and many budding partnerships.  The team is going to carry the momentum from Cannes throughout the summer, taking MAD on a roadshow to continue conversations with companies all over the world. Traditional media companies know that big change is coming -- and the big players are excited to participate in shaping the future together with MAD.  ANNOUNCEMENTS 1.) MAD is officially on the AdLedger Board!  We helped co-found AdLedger many months ago, and we can’t wait to continue working with the new board members, including companies like IBM, Omnicom, IPG, TEGNA, Meredith Corp., Salon Media, & Coindesk to create standards for the entire ecosystem.

"Hi all - we know you’re eager for updates, and thank you for your patience.   Privacy in advertising is new. Re-engineering advertising with privacy-by-design is not something that will happen overnight - but will be the result of thousands of man-hours of coding, research, experimentation, testing and iteration by the team.   We’ve got new technical publications coming out in the next couple weeks which will give you insight into our technical approach and thinking.  But that doesn’t mean there’s no code ready. We’re also planning to open source some of the cryptographic libraries we’ve developed that are critical for privacy. We believe these are a much needed addition to the blockchain community at large. Since privacy is a huge problem to tackle, and we want to encourage as much development with our code as possible, we’re busy vetting it before publication!  Please don’t underestimate how critical the partnerships formed and reinforced at events like Cannes Lions are for success - both in business and for product development! To build great product you need to collaborate with your market - and that’s exactly what we’re doing!  Based on the relationships we’ve forged at events around the world, we have a new partnership in the works with major publishers and the largest blockchain consortium for advertising to begin selling inventory to brands through the MAD Network. Like all good things, it’s not going to all come together overnight - but we hope to have more news towards the end of the summer.  Very, very exciting stuff!  We’ll let the community know in this channel as soon as we publish our new papers and code. Stay tuned - and thank you again for your patience.",irr
what is this coin about? -network-token,neu
"   MAD Network created the first blockchain protocol for digital advertising with privacy-by-design. Instead of customers’ data be held in a centralized data store, MAD allows their data to be stored completely on their own devices. By leveraging their data locally, MAD can pull in the best ads for each individual at the right time, in the right context, delivering the best possible advertising experience. Over the next year the MAD token will be integrated into the Madhive suite of products - aka advertisers will be able to pay for ad buys using Madhive in MAD token!  The Advertisers can stake MAD token to create an insertion order (IO), which is a smart contract that specifies how ads should be executed.  Madhive has tons of brand equity in the advertising and media world, our key markets. So it’s important we transition that equity slowly and intentionally. We are starting to transition MadHive’s brand equity over to MAD Network in a big way at Cannes Lions this year. We’re also in the process of tweaking both brands to visually reflect each other more.  You can visit our website here: ",neu
"Project UPDATE: Anyone got an AD TECH question??  At MAD, we focus our time, energy, and brain power on building a new protocol for the advertising industry... and A TON of progress has been made.  As everyone with an interest in cryptocurrency knows, there are a lot of projects who make extremely bold claims and unrealistic goals simply to boost the price of their token. We don’t do that here. We understand there is frustration in the community regarding MAD Token, but we believe in the long term success of our project. This team has what it takes to revolutionize the advertising industry - but as we’ve said many times, it will not happen overnight. It will take not only hours and hours of coding, but also partnerships with the right industry players to make it work!  We have critical partnerships under our belt already, with more to come. New papers and documentation are coming soon. And we have dozens of conferences booked to spread the word and educate the market about MAD. So for those of you in it to win it, buckle up, the ride has just begun.  As our friend Jarrod Dicker, CEO of The Po.et Project, said yesterday, “ It’s the quietest projects that competitors should be most concerned about. Especially now. Less talking means more listening and more building. The quiet, focused projects of today will be the loudest in terms of usability, utility and user base tomorrow.” We couldn’t agree more.  We love discussing advertising, blockchain, or what tech we plan to implement, because we’re ad tech nerds. We rarely get questions like this from our community and urge you guys to ask about these important things as opposed to the same old questions about topics we can’t legally answer.  Want to help shape the future of ad tech?  Bring the ideas!  We’d love support from the community about the meat of our project!  “Meet the MAD Team: Gabe Greenberg”  Our latest, “Meet the MAD Team” blog features Gabe Greenberg, a member of MAD’s Advisory Board.

CryptoRTB claims to be first in the market to leverage a distributed, immutable ledger (blockchain) with additional cryptographic technology to solve the problem of “garbage in, garbage out.” Most current Blockchain projects invite companies to track whether something happened. However, writing fake or bad data to a blockchain doesn’t make it true or trustworthy.  MAD’s platform adds additional cryptography to let actors know if the data is true or false. This added innovation will impart the value to authenticate a campaign’s performance, as well as its targeting data, then leveraging blockchain, will create an immutable record.

The CryptoRTB test activation was initially unveiled on a panel at DMEXCO including MAD Network founder and CEO Adam Helfgott and Omnicom Media Group Chief Research Officer Jonathan Steuer, moderated by Gabe Greenberg, CEO of Gabbcon.  CryptoRTB, which has been designed to provide cost transparency for advertisers, optimize media weight per dollar spent and eliminate waste from the value chain, will be tested by an Omnicom Media Group EMEA client.

Here is the latest update:    Hi MAD Community,  We have been working hard to develop solutions for the digital advertising industry and I want to update the community on 5 major developments:  1/ Token Bonus for Holders from our initial public Token Sale. 2/ New Whitepaper! 3/ Development and Product Roll Out. 4/ Industry Traction. 5/ Telegram AMA on May 7  1/ THE MAD BONUS PROGRAM: We want to thank the original token holders who have supported our project with a token bonus!  For those who participated in the December 2017 ICO and still hold their tokens, please fill out this google form for your 10% bonus: -xTxEcj4xIamDUBpjMfP0ZGyEAygVgQ/viewform.  Once we verify that you are a token holder, etc. we will distribute the bonus to you.  IMPORTANT: The bonus program lasts for 30 days, so if you’re still holding, please fill out the form ASAP!  2/ NEW WHITEPAPER: We have just published our new Whitepaper, which is available on our website:  The new whitepaper is the result of countless hours of research, outreach and validation with key players in the industry.  It outlines how we use cryptography and blockchain concepts to not only impart trust into the ad tech supply chain, but also eliminate fraud, and create a new foundation for advertising in the era of the Internet of Things.  We’re super excited to share it with the community and look forward to hearing your feedback.  3/ THE WATCHGRAPH: Our Watchgraph, a creative new mechanism that imparts trust and governance into the ad tech supply chain, is now patent pending. Full detail about the watchgraph can be found in our whitepaper ().  The Watchgraph applies key tenets of decentralization to ad tech in a truly innovative way.  It’s a revolutionary new concept, and has been incredibly well received by the major agencies, TV manufacturer OEMs, and data companies. The first use case of the token will be implemented through our partner Madhive: By leveraging MAD Networks technology, TV OEMs and supply partners will be able to secure the identity / owner of the household of the TV, as well as the publisher, and commit to data quality. This enables OTT ad sales to be purchased in a completely private manner. We are under an NDA as to the details, but I am happy to share with members of the community as details emerge.  4/ ADLEDGER UPDATES: AdLedger, the nonprofit consortium of which MAD Network is a founding member, continues to grow and lead the industry forward in its mission to build cohesive rules and standards for the application of blockchains and cryptography to media and advertising. Every major advertising agency is on board, and Brave recently announced their membership: -attention-tokens-bat-brave-browser-joins-ibm-founded-adledger/  5/ UPCOMING AMA ON TELEGRAM: MAD Network Chief Scientist, Aaron Brown, and I will host a Telegram AMA on May 7 from 7 to 8PM EST.

We look forward to hearing from everyone!  MAD Network’s mission will take real work - especially in this bear economy. We are ready and facing these challenges head-on, helping bring change to an industry that does not always easily accept it.

"   Haha fair enough  . To quote from MAD's FAQ in answer:  Quote Why does digital advertising need a new protocol? Today’s programmatic advertising ecosystem is broken. The symptoms of its failure are easy to spot. In 2018 alone, ad fraud will cost the industry $51 million per day totaling $18 billion. By the end of 2016, over 600M devices worldwide were using ad blockers (over half of which were mobile) – representing a 30% increase year over year. Ad blocking may be the strongest indicator yet that not only is the system broken – it’s no longer aligned with the very people with whom it’s intended to communicate: the consumer.  Adding insult to injury, ad taxes and ad fraud are at an all-time high, while trust and transparency are at an all-time low. Advertisers are spending more and more to reach consumers, while publishers are making less and less. Yet as costs rise, advertisers still can’t track the customer’s journey or how their budgets are truly spent.

"   Great Question!  The balance on the users account can be locked in a local FIAT balance and payments can be issued through a Virtual Visa/debit for the alco store and for your flat payments you can either use a live or online converter to get cash to issue direct payments.

"Well this sure doesn't seem like a fly by night operation getting involved. Toll free phone numbers, automated voice mobile phone verification. An interesting twist trying an IBO.  Your Get Your uCASH page is really confusing though, it does appear as though the benefactor pop up can get confused with bounties, also where am I supposed to enter my email address? Seems more like a bug to me,  like the wrong entry field is being displayed (the bounty one and not the email address one)  Incidentally you should have bug reporting bounties! ",irr
"     I can see how this can be confusing as well, we will take this in considerations and implement changes based on your suggestions. We are also in the midst of redesigning the website we we expect some changes to make the user experience effortless and easy to understand.  Did you get that pop up after clicking participate now? Before you got to the benefactor selection you should have been prompted to enter a name and log in information after clicking the participate now button. Then you should be able to select what bounty you would like to a benefactor for.  We will have bug bounties available once we have released the new app and website.  Thanks for your interest and support in the future!",irr
"     Correct, I did receive the pop up first to register then to be a benefactor.  Can you describe the benefits of being a benefactor please? I'm not sure I understand why I'd use my uCASH to pay for others to say tweet about uCASH as an example.",irr
"  \  Thank you! We will continue to announce new developments and bounties, so keep your ear low to the ground.  JM",irr
"I just completed on email verification but I didn't get an Verification Code on my phone, how long it takes, i've been waiting for 1 hours but still do not have that Verification Code",irr
"   Great question! In this case you would keep your UCASH currency and gain prepaid access to U.CASH Services. Also as a Benefactor, you get to decide how your benefaction will be allocated.  A good analogy would be;  Lets say UCASH is a telecom company and we wanted to build a new cell phone network. In this case the UCASH currency would be prepaid access to our networks. Now lets say that when you purchased the prepaid access, as an added bonus, you got to decide where your benefaction can be used. In this case, lets say you cared most about a faster network you can choose to benefact network upgrades. Or... Lets say you prefer that you have access to a larger cell network, you can choose to benefact the buidling of more towers.  In this case you get to weigh in on the development of the ecosystem.  So in our case, if you believe that more users are important you can choose to benefact user sign ups, if you feel social media exposure is more effective you can choose social media bounties.  I hope i answered your question",irr
"    Hi Mia, would be happy to help.  You should receive a phone call not a text for the verification code. Did you receive a call?  Regards,  JM",irr
Oh.we have to give money for them if we want to take free token.?You asking for money.,irr
"   That's for ""benefactors"" which are different from bounties. Visit this page for bounties: ",irr
"   No you do not, you earn the U.CASH token by opening an account and verifying it. Just time is needed. You can also earn UCASH by translating our website or whitepaper, and much more.  Find out more in our U.CASH ANN thread link in the original post",irr
"There sure are alot of bounties on offer, just be aware of how much your privacy is worth and if the amount of UCash you are getting is worth it, not diggin at Ucash just at crypto in general.",neu

What is needed to get 500 Ucash: to fill in all the empty fileds in Account Verification section? (I added the Two-Factor Authentication and number of Ucash increased),neu
   Validating email and phone number gets you just under 300 U.Cash.  According to the web page validating your identity gets you 500 U.Cash. I personally wouldn't send my Identity in. The rep here isnt that active and they haven't given many updates as to when this coin is going to launch.,neu
Doubtful project. To receive the award there is no admission.,neu
"   Since the U.Cash rep isn't giving any updates, I guess I will provide one.  They still give free U.Cash  for signing up ( currently 290 U.Cash ). You have to validate both your email and phone ( auto text message ) to receive. Keep in mind it cost 300 U.Cash to transfer from the onsite wallet to where ever you are sending it.  U.Cash is currently on one exchange but according to the U.Cash Reddit ( which is just as dead as this forum topic ) they are on wait list(s) to be added to others.  For affiliates ...  U.Cash stopped awarding affiliates for new sign ups. When they officially stopped this I am unsure but its been at least a week.",neu
Just got 290.53211013 UCASH Bounty For Account Verification  Hope it will be a great project soon Thanks guys!!,neu

İ have 301.7 ucash  fee:300 ucash Than i have 1.7 ucash,neu
Interesting .... What is the reason for the sudden jump in value. I got a little over 11000 of these coins on the official U.Cash site. Anyone know how long it takes to transfer to BTC Alpha. This is likely a pump and dump .... Has any news been release about the coin today ?,neu
   Those who sell high and buy low will get something. I got mine for free so I will just hold and see how everything plays out.,neu
"   I have no clue if they have or not. Hasn't U.Cash been around for 4 + years ? I am not defending the coin btw. I got of what I have via  bounties.  I think it peaked at 11 cents today, who knows U.Cash might surprise everyone. Lots are calling it a scam.",neu
just got 290 coins for verification of phone number. don't know how much it will be worthy. Thanks anyway.,neu
Can i reserve Vietnamese translation please ?,irr
Do I understand correctly that you are offering ~50k $ for translating the white paper?,neu
When are the withdraw fees reduced?,neu
Just maby it isn't a pump and dump ...   currently at 25 cents ... debating on if I should sell my 11000 ucash or not.,neu
Hey hey heeeeyyyyy! Wasa wasa wasa wasa wasa wasa wasa wasaaaaap UUUUCASH!  Seems legit.,neu
This coin just had a massive pump I sure hope this is sustainable,neu
Coin was almost at a high of 30 cents and is currently at 17 cents .. Watching the chat on Alpha BTC and it is very amusing. ( Alpha chat requires you to deposit Bitcoin first before chatting ) .....  The poor investors caught in the middle ...,neu
"if this coin listed on another exchange not only on BTC - Alpha this will be better because this price movement look strange for me,, with a massive pump",neu
  Nope. It's the just-got-listed-on-CMC pump. ,neu
  how can we transfer btc-alpha?,neu
Anyone able to withdraw from BTC-Alpha?,neu

"ucash pump 0,3$.ucash. Oh sh!t",neu
Why it went to moon? Pump n dump? Or something else?,neu
One other full centralised ERC20 project.,neu
   The offer is stil valid??? If i open an account i recive 500UCASH ?  Regards,neu
"It is being pumped huge $0.198853 USD (869.22%) but only on one exchange I'm not impressed at all, I think it's being manipulated Btc alpha is not a popular exchange first time I read about it and I don't know if it is good exchange to trade with.",neu
"   I have just registered an account, receive 289 ucash token.",neu
another P&D manipulation? cya at 0.01USD?,neu
"How can I transfer UCASH to btc-Alpha? There is some strange process, cause I have one way. only to send Customer.",neu
   It could take awhile. People are claiming 3 - 10 days. While Alpha BTC claims it could take up to 3 days. I requested a transfer to Alpha about 12 hours ago and still no coins.,neu
"   When you log in to the official U.CASH site, click the menu link and then from the list click send ucash. Don't forget it cost 300 UCASH to send any amount of coins so leave at least 300 behind in your account or you will get an error message.",neu
"It really looks like a scam, but if it is not. I mean the cashbullies are buying it now, because they understand, that it is going up, not only pump and dump.",neu
I also got 288.36695926 Ucash. I will just leave it there for now.,neu
   This happens when you don't leave enough in your account to cover the transfer fee.  For example if you have 1300 UCASH  Transfer 1000 and leave 300 in your account to cover transfer fees. If you try to transfer without leaving 300 behind to cover fees you will get an error message.  Also make sure you are in the right section. You have to log in to the main site and click menu. From the menu select send ucash.,neu
   You have no other choice but to leave it there unless you can get some more somehow. Transfer fees are 300 UCASH.,neu
"So it will be a P2P exchange correct? As P2P, will not my data be requested to register and use the exchange?",neu
  Do you think it will be 300 UCASH even if price increases significantly?,neu
    Activate your google authenticator you will receive 60 ucash more and you can create many account for take free coin after you you send all on one ucash account transfert between ucash is free no fees  i do like that i get 1015 UCASH,neu
   I did a transfer off 299 to BTC Alpha trade. Just to check if it really was 300 transfer fee. It's not it's 5 for transferfee. That said I did the withdrawal almost 2 hours ago. Still have not received it in my Alpha Ucash wallet.,neu
   6h i m waiting now nothing to came on my wallet,neu

"""UCASH will initially be an ERC20 token.""  No thanks. After watching the whole Monero Gold debacle unfold, I'll be steering clear of anything ERC20 related that doesn't tied directly into a product. I hold ERC20 tokens, but this will not be one of them. Buyer beware. Just my humble opinion and no disrespect to U.CASH, just know you set your ship out in known dangerous waters.",neu
I think they need to rebrand to the following logo. UCRASH,neu

Why should I call it scam if the project was worth to be involved in? There are no real feats to call this project scam.",neu
I cant help but wonder what the price would be without all the scam talk. This place is full of it .. Reddit the same.  What makes this coin a scam exactly ? For those screaming scam lets hear your reasons as to why it is ....  The coin is available and on an exchange. People are making money from it.  IF you buy high and it crashes .. to me that isn't a scam coin. It part of investing.  Also I want to point out failing projects are not scams either...... failing does not = scam.  The word scam gets thrown around way too easily.,neu
   Let's wait little more -- maybe goes fee further down.,neu
   Lol! That six bold letter makes sense! The 229 Ucrash sign-up bonus is useless for the 300 Ucrash fee unless you got plenty of down-lines under your referral  link just like thee pyramid system!!,neu
I have 500 free Ucash in my account and I don't actually know how to withdraw it or what to do with it. Also I don't think there is any reason to call a project that has not demanded money from you scam.,neu
wow how did this happen 2m $ volume and you can get it on bounty. wow wow wow,neu

"Still waiting for my withdrawal transfer, 5 UCASH fee which was a pleasant surprise, it's been 12hrs now...if it comes through we're good.   p.s XMRG was a great eye opener for me as a noob in this world, i was in the airdrop only thankfully, but watching their telegram chat in the midst of it was painful.",neu
   Apparently you can climb into the top 25 just like that as UCASH did it.  As you said 2+2 is 4.  Nothing you said relates to U.CASH being a scam. Just the potential it could be one.   Edit:  As a side note has anyone signed someone up through an affiliate link the last day or two ? I was told commissions for bringing new sign ups were disabled but I have got a report from at least one other affiliate saying they are being credited for the sign ups they bring.,neu
hey  i asking about the withdraw is taking too long time last time is took 6 days to receive  it in myetherwallet so i asking for speeding the withdraw to continue support you great project and i still support you ♥,neu
   I never invested any money. All my U.CASH came from bounties.  Good luck to you as well !,neu
   I am doing neither.  What makes it a scam exactly ? I am not saying it isn't. I just haven't seen any concrete proof it is.  Has someone bought U.CASH with funds and not been given the amount of U.Cash they purchased  ? Withdrawal is taking long but has someone actually not gotten their withdrawal yet ?  Its being traded on an exchange. The  token is live. So again how is it a scam ?  Something is worth as much as someone else is willing to pay for it. If you over pay that doesn't make the thing you bought a scam.,neu

It does , I signed up dozens of members. They all got their free coins and so have I.  2. Live chat varies for me. I see Last live 1 hour ago. Last live 15 minutes ago ect.  3. Some of the site functions are disabled. More work today then did last week. Transfer to inner accounts work and so do transfers to exchanges.  4. This thread was started on Nov.  2017.   [/quote]",neu
   Affiliate bonuses are disabled due to people taking advantage of the system and signing up dummy accounts for free UCASH. This is also one of the reasons for slow cashout process. The team is working on getting a new affiliate system in place. At least that is what I was told via ucash chat and other contacts.,neu
"many are constrained by the process of withdrawal of U.cash balance, perhaps because again many requests themselves. . . but the lack of implementation and preparation in the face of this is their biggest obstacle",neu
"    I agree with you, just read an information - IBO Time remaining as shown on the website. 1 Day 10 Hours 29 Minutes 33 Seconds.  How come base on this announcement is IBO completed.  I'll suggest the developers behind this project should read the thread/forum so that they maybe aware of the bounty hunters concern particularly process of withdrawal of U.cash [/quote]",neu
"wow people get 50 k ucash lol how can i miss this !!   However  THANKS FOR THE 301,    regards,",neu
"I had 500 UCASH at my account. I transferred it to ETH wallet and 300 discount was applied. I mean, discounts’ rate is remaining. However I gained 200 at the moment, around 20 dollars, I’ll keep it, maybe it gets pumped and I sell them then..",neu
Hello everybody. Tell me please. I participate in the bounty program for this coin. How can I withdraw the coins from my office? Thanks for the answer. Good luck everyone.,neu
"   Go to the menu option on the main site. Click withdraw UCASH. Leave enough behind to cover the transaction fee, which I think is only 5 ucash at the moment.  You will see it processing. Wait times are 24 hrs up to days.",neu
   Wow that is a long time. Go to official site and message the online support and also email support. Then go here (  ) and start a topic asking for help. The reps are somewhat active in the threads.  I know they been blocking some accounts due to the abuse of the affiliate program. Maby you got caught up in the mess.  Good Luck !,neu
They will not distribute as long as they want to keep the market moving. They are safe until whole supply or at least very large portion is sitting in their hands because they know everything should be under control for such activities. No way to touch this token at least in its present condition.,neu
     How did you end up with 5000 + UCASH ?  They have been suspending accounts that took advantage of the affiliate program. Meaning there are a group that signed up multiple dummy accounts to collect the free ucash bonus.  Hopefully you didn't get caught in the cross fire.,neu
Why is the withdrawal rate still 300 UCASH?  On site you are informed that this fee is 5 UCASH!   ,neu
"wow, u.Cash is traded in  now",neu
"   You have to put a fee of 300 ucash, so it works. ",neu
So like i said month ago tx fee was lowered to 5 tokens,neu
  I get that with bounties they thief me much more points not caught me because I wrote to many articles and they dont set hiw they promised in bounty but I think u are a team of ucash anonymosly here.,neu
   If you look at the bounty page you will see they say unavailable. You wrote them for nothing.  I am not a team member but I do hold some UCASH so I been keeping up to date with it and trying to help others here with the information I am finding. Would you rather I stop ?  I just found out that anyone that has signed up recently to UCASH will not be able to transfer the UCASH in there account for up to 30 days. This is due to the amount of people abusing the sign up bonus. Creating multiple accounts and such. So if you are one of those people congrats on ruining it on everyone else.,neu
"Bounties stoped when ico ended token sale. Im not  here to stop anyone and I cant stop anyone. Im not registered this week in ucash but a long time ago and just  leave the tokens  didnt bleve and Im not believing on those  tokens,simple logic P2P network to make 5 days for withdraw ? Im not hoping for that , im not seeing the coins as a money but as a technology behind it. If they are real they will prove that if not nothing im just worried about bg invstitors if thhats scam..",neu
i cant move coin from the wallet :S why ?,neu
   Are you a new account ? If so there is a 30 day waiting period due to the abuse of the free ucash sign up bonus.,neu
     yes and that rule was new today but i had already moved coins and i have them not in my wallet or in any exchange now,neu
   So you got your coins then.  From my knowledge the rule was announced Feb. 14 th  They likely applied the rule to newer accounts that signed before that date as well but that is just speculation on my part.,neu
   no i dont have any coins left i moved them to exchange 4-5 days ago now they are lost. before it was on the history of the account now its not even there,neu
new news ? gm,neu
   Log in to the official site and send a message via live chat. You may have to wait days for a response.  I know they are looking through accounts and anyone who has abused the free ucash system is getting their transfer canceled and ucash removed from account.,neu
   Not a scam look at the team behind it they just added it to another exchange site give it time to breath it's only 5 days old when ever a new token comes out it always booms then drops then goes back up good things come to those who wait and the key to Crypto HODL,neu

"I saw a big dump for this coin, which was unexpectedly horrible. Hope it would get recovery soon.",neu

Scammers abusing the free coin system   Quote from: moondus on February 17, 2018, 10:16:28 PM This is how the ucash scam works. First they make you open a wallet and give you coins, and then you can not withdraw the coins. With the coins lock up in your walllet the price will go up, and then they dump the coins that they have on the exchange. They also ask for your ID to get your information, to open credit in your name, when they shit coin fail. Fools wake up and smell the coffee.  I got my free coins with no issue. All made from referrals, 11000 coins. I never sent in any ID.  Allot of scammers got a bunch of free coins. They are trying to sort it out and recover those coins. Causing transfer to be slow. That is the official word from them.",neu

"Hello community. Are the any official explanation why it is impossible to receive u cash in the wallets? As to coinmarketcap, ucash made 1.5 billion volume in 24h - that means something is moving somewhere and someone is buying/selling it.",neu
   Shut up fool. You better have some proof before you call someone a scammer. So  lets see that proof.  I been active in the thread because I been following the coin closely and was trying to help the community with the information I have found.  Would you rather silence because the reps obviously dont visit the thread anymore and I dont see many others addressing questions.  I got my coins because I earned them the legit way. With NO SIGN UPS from my computer or IP address. I signed up 0 family members. I have been doing affiliate work for years. I earned my coins through hard work of getting complete strangers to sign up through my links.  Legit accounts or not ... If you signed up multiple accounts through the same computer / IP address then you only have yourself to blame for not getting your coins.,neu
Ucash is down.. don't know what will happen to all my (2000 Ucash) referral coins ..,neu
    You'll never receive anything... Bitconnect X 1 000,neu

"   account has recovered aka the phoenix bird. But how long? or soon burn again ... the crematorium is already blazing ... gods can burn you any time... fun!!!  But seriously, there should be no deletions and burnings, you should give an opportunity to verify pseudo-scam accounts, for example, to confirm the identity through the passport and account, and all not virified account-tokens will be blocked forever. But now everything looks like a special promotion to raise the rating and token volatility.",neu
      I wish I was.  I don't have your coins and I don't know if this coin will be a scam or not. People not getting free coins don't = scam to me.  good luck with getting your FREE* coins.,neu
     I said yes to being the master-mind behind this coin. Not to scamming fool.  People not getting free coins don't equal scam to me.  If you made purchases and never abused the sign up bonus and never got your coins then you have an argument. If you just haven't received your free coins yet and are yelling scam then you are a fool.,neu

Advice:  Don't make multiple accounts even if those accounts are legit accounts for family members, do not make them. It only increasing the chances of your coins being froze and added to the burn pile.  I don't even hold any UCASH at the moment btw.  If you are going to call someone a scammer show proof.",neu

This is scam now? I have not received my withdrawn since 02/13/2018,neu
      If you are new account then you have to wait at least 30 days for a transfer.,neu
"  If the account is blocked for 30 days. why does money leave, but do not come?",neu
   I am not a rep and I dont completely understand your question.  All I know is if you are a new account you will not get your coin transfer  for at least 30 days.  Some will not get their coins at all if the owners think you are trying to cheat the system. I advise not making multiple accounts from the same computer or IP address. Legit or not. As it could get your coins taken from you.,neu
"  If the coins are blocked, then I can not do anything with them. If I sent the coins and they left my account then they are not blocked.",neu
"Well this is exhibit A (if they are using the Ethereum blockchain network) why Ethereum Classic, LISK, NEO, and NEM and Cardano (when complete) will offer scalable and less congested solutions for new projects and ICOs. I was a member of the Crypterium ICO (ERC20 token), it took well over a week to 10 days to get my coins once they took them from their wallet and transferred to me.  I guess my point is I place as much of this on the network...however, from this point forward coins need to understand using the ETH network could spell congestion and delays for mass distribution. Neblio is working on this as well...",neu
Anyone got lucky receiving u cash on any kind of exchange ? Or still waiting for a miracle ?,neu
   So are you emphasizing us that the main reason for not receiving Ucash by any means  is due to Network Congestion?,neu
   I received mine weeks ago. I know of others that have got transfers as well and others that haven't.  Keep in mind if you are a new account you have to wait 30 days before you get a transfer.   Good Luck !,neu
added trading platform ,neu
   So just checked my balance at BTC Alpha and my 299 coins arrived.,neu
Didn't received my ucash from withdraw 14 days ago... so scam?,neu
     No...not the main reason. But it has to be contributing to whatever delay if these coins or tokens are having trouble being distributed post ICO and IBO by whatever new Cyrpto. I have no other clue as to why things are so slow besides that and allegations of fraudulent withdrawels which are making the scrutinize each withdrawal of coins.,neu
  I do not think it's necessary to invent an excuse for the developer. The team coins very well come to the exchange and the participants do not. The simplest explanation is what?,neu

is this project abandoned?,neu
I don't think that this has been abandoned because the way this market was moved in its early days. Most probably there will be many repeated cycles of ups and downs when most of the people would have dumped their coins. Some people are filling up their bag and they control its moves and are full of patience.,neu

   Posters like you should have to show evidence of your claims or be banned / suspended from this forum.  I haven't held any ucash since the price was last 12 cents. I followed the coin somewhat closely and was answering members questions  with the information I found out from my research. If you actually read my post you would see that I advised against giving out ID. One's security is worth more then a few dollars in coins. That goes for any coin not just ucash.  As they say .. no good deed goes unpunished.,neu

The word scam gets thrown around way too much. If you signed up and had to wait 30 days to receive your FREE COINS .. that is not a scam.  The rep here was not responding.

So it's like saying this project is centralized i.e. it has a single point of failure.  Right?",neu

Many are quite true to their word and often dispense the funds received in a judicious, honest and expedient manner; however, I'd prefer not to put my trust and safety of my funds in centralized and trust-dependent organisations like those we currently have. This for me is one of the attractions of blockchain technology and solutions- a means to remove trust totally from the equation. My question to you guys is how does Commit Good tackle issues of trust and transparency- to be honest I have some idea of what you are proposing, but I would like it clarified from your end!",neu
"When will we try MVP? Will it be before ICO end or after? How your platform will look for end-user of 3rd party site that wishes to make a donation - I been redirected to your site, authorized with metamask, pay and then redirected back to charities website?",neu

From the ANN thread post, you claim that the Commit Good service is an ecosystem that can reward people for making deliveries, I want to understand this more.

"   This project is a complete joke. For gosh sake, they have over 70 million dollars, and can't put up some money listing nvst in exchange. The fees in counterparty are 50$ and the volume is 0.2 BTC, for a project of this magnitude with 15 million coins this is complete fail. The devs are frugal amateurs that can't manage a project and do not  business acumen. This is the worst investment in 2017, every shitcoin performed better and pumped x5-10 ( all in top 100 did) while nvo is x4 less then ico price! I feel sorry for those who hold their useless nvst and lose money and opportunities.  They lack roadmap, no deadlines of any kind, only false promises 0 communication, careless behavior. The community is dead only 10 people are active in slack, this project is 7 months old and the community is more dead than ever, it didn't expanded by one bit. ""We are ahead of schedule"". They are so slow and didn't hire team to improve development, don't have PR, no marketing as promised.  Bare in mind they can't fix the bugs in the wallet, atm it's not usable and you can't withdraw. Their progress is extremely slow. They need to fix all the bugs, which will take a lot of time, then do all the improvements on the wallet they planned afterwards they need to do the temporary exchange and finaly the dex. With such rates, DEX will be delivered in 2019-2020 IF THEY MANAGE TO DO IT ALL. Honestly, they are very incompetent and don't have the skills to bring a basic wallet, the dex is innovation that nobody made so far and it will be x100 times harder to do. You can't build project like that with 3 people and be stingy spending money that WE GAVE YOU.  I'm from the project since day one, but they are real disappointment and complete failure. A lot of people left already. I'm glad that i sold majority of my stake. The sooner you get rid of the tokens, the better.

What? Who gives a shit what the lying developers and their team of shills say? Proof of work in transparent and independent sites like github are all that matters.

Move on and go spend your millions. You will no doubt rip someone off at some point in life and you will get what is coming to you.

There is no NVO wallet. It's all an elaborate scam. Please go to their slack and look at the screen shots posted as proof of work. The exchange they claim to show as proof has the wrong name listed in upper left corner of photo. The github they post is for Xenio which is another scam they are running as a token sale. Same developer and same fake marketer Alexander. Read thru the forum I posted which shows their true character. They are spamming my account after posting this to discredit my username. Check who wrote and the times. They did this right after i called them out. Anybody with a shred of intelligence would read thru that forum and also look at the evidence they have posted as proof of work and know they are lying.  I have also reported them to counterparty and the SEC. They can continue to lie and cheat everyone all they want but Tone and Alexander and the developer will eventually pay for their actions.,neg

I agree 100% with your statements.  The thread on Slack is even worse. I hope they heed your suggestions and start  sending REGULAR updates.  Things seem to be getting shakier with every minute that passes since the original day stated as the start of distribution.,neg
"This thread is insane.  A few comments for the developers:  1. Stop spending all your time blaming your customers for their mistakes.  Yes, we get it - you're unhappy they didn't read the instructions and it's caused you a bunch of extra work.  However, when tons of people do it, perhaps the problem was in the quality of the instructions.  This should be of special concern to a company who's key goal is to build a simple easy-to-use interface.    2. Stop using this thread and Slack as your only means of communications.  You have a website.  Use it to post updates where everyone can see them, instead of people having to hunt through message boards to find the latest news.  Your website hasn't been updated at all since the crowdsale ended.  Posting updates is not hard - or at least, it shouldn't be for people who saying they can set up a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.  And it's a whole hell of a lot more efficient that posting individual responses to a bunch of message board posts.    3. Don't do ridiculous things like post on twitter that people can get their money back, without any explanation of why you're suddenly offering that service or what has changed.  A medium that limits you to 140 characters and is not remotely read by the majority of your investors is not the appropriate venue for a gigantic piece of news like that.  EDIT: You also have everyone's email addresses when they signed up for your Crowdsale.  That's another route to communicating with people that ensures that everyone sees it instead of just whoever's on these random forums.  You raised upwards of $7 million from a lot of people.  That's great and means a lot of people believe in your project.  You have to now act like the leaders of a legitimate company, instead of acting like children on a message board and being annoyed that people want information about the money they gave you.  You have a responsibility to communicate openly and clearly with the people that put their faith in you and invested in you.  ",neg

Also, the use of a ""friend"" of the founder who does not speak English and uses Google translate to answer questions on this message forum leads me to believe this is a mickey mouse operation.  If everyone is so tired and stressed during the crowd sale which basically encompasses answering questions of potential investors.  How is this going to be a successful operation when stressful and tiring development deadlines approach?  I was a software engineering consultant for 25+ years, in that time I don't ever remember losing my cool in front of an actual or potential customer/investor.

Conversions to new technology solutions where failure meant the entire company was sitting on their hands and the business ground to a halt....meaning lost revenue and profit.

Now they do control there market (token dominance) and news control (they decide about good and bad news). They dont care about there community, only there money.  Project is still death. SCAM just goes on atm. But all eyes from regulation forces are on them. Send russian diplomats in your contry a mail and inform them about SONM. You will see they are verry friendly and helpfull.",neg

"Latest Sonm news:  ""From what we know Sonm is being used by at least:  Rays startup CraftML startup  ""  Rays is Sonm team ,making a private company with SNM ICO funds and generating 31$ from fiat payments ( one week ago) since the start . CraftML startup is : https://www.instagram.com/gods_dew/  Also they somehow claim that it is not 42mln $ but something else. At ICO all projects put some number as a goal.Some put 2 mln $ some have put 400mln $. Sonm at summer of 2017 put a number and goal of 42mln$. After the ICO ended they succesufully announced that they have reached their goal for collecting 42mln$. You may check how many tens of thousands of ETH they collected. It is not anyone problem but the team that they didnt convert those ETH into fiat for funding the project. They keep saying that they have delivered but where are the clients for what they have delivered? Their clients are RAYS and CraftML .The second being completely unknown and as i suppose some friend of a team sonm team member. Check the instagram above to see who is gonna mass use the Sonm marketplace. Now they are asking for second round of funding to continue to work for the greater good and there are still people that believe them. The former CEO Igor lebedev now the proud owner of RAYS keep saying that all the ICO participant were not investors but DONATORS. Thats official from telegram rooms. If i may kindly ask.Where in this thread or sonm website,or SONM ICO campaign or original WP there is a single mention of donations and donators?  They took 42mln $, they dumped 19% of the tokens on your heads, they did insider trading and controlled the market of their own token, now they will ask for more money .  BTW if you were wondering why they didnt wanted to put SONM next to RAYS and mention anywhere that they are connected now i think you get it. Another thing i find really odd and kinda strange is  that the timing of the announcement that SONM stops developments and has no more team comes right after the moment team has spent all the 19% of the tokens they controlled ( except 2 mln maybe ? ).",irr
"   Man! some user on telegram said that you confessed to him via private message that you are now cooperating with SONM team because you like DAO idea and even you are bag holding SNM token, Obviously they want to push DAO idea through your name.   DAO solution to save SONM project Same team responsible for ICO fund scam exit. Same team sank SNM token value to few satoshi by dumping millions of token on binance. Same team still promising everyone that DAO will make SNM token more valuable and ofcourse without any budget to develop the project and some clowns (with all my respect to investors who lost money in SNM) on telegram channel expecting different results",neg
All Russian projects Are Scam because russian children learn to steal and cheat in schools. Russia is a country full of crooks,neg
"After you pulled to the last drop of profit from SNM project NOW you talking about DAO and get community involved in decisions or whatever, Nice try guys you now playing the role of SNM savior after you took millions of dollars and dumped 44 millions token on the face of your community and i remember you were answering every one of telegram that you wasn't dumping on binance ,The thing that amazed me more that now you asking indirectly desperate bag holders to fund you in order to keep maintaining the project and you literally said it it will be a hobby to keep maintaining SNM, Do you ever though that some of investors trusted all their money life saving in SNM project and now they are in heavy debts or they are living homeless in streets cant afford to rent a house, You people behind SNM are monsters without any living soul inside your bodies Suddenly all of you started talking truth on telegram, Why you didnt reveal all of that before you disappear with millions of $$$ Why you hide the fact that you were dumping millions of tokens on binance, Why community should trust persons who took millions and abandoned project, Why community should trust liars who were secretly dumping millions of tokens until drive SNM price to dust value, What happened to ICO fund, hundred of unanswered questions need to be brought to light before you start talking about DAO and get community involved.

Guys. Just remember : all of russian crypto projects - scams.,neg
"It is easily to check how much you got? You gonna save Sonm with statements like that? Some admin made you sonm ceo and you announced it and now it is a joke? You got 2 mln SNM ,than few minutes later you got 2 mln SNM + 2000 ETH.... Now lets talk about millions.... Where those 100 000 ETH from the ICO went? Even at todays prices this is equal to many many millions of $.Where are those money? And maybe you Voronkov can fund Sonm now and pay for the development with those 2 mln SNM and 2 000 ETH you got? What about that? Now when Ponomarev is back he can fund Sonm with his money too? You wanna make DAO go ahead you two may lead and lock few millions $ to kick start the project. But you both dont have any money cause you didnt get anything from Sonm and you gonna ask the community now right? And noone cares if ETH went to 80 or went to 1400$. The team is obligated right after the end of the ICO to turn the  received ETH/BTC into fiat for the development of the company.Not holding it or investing it in other crypto for their personal gains. At the ICO team asked for 42mln$. 42 mln $ SONM ICO was all over the internet. Now you and especially Igor Lebedev the proud owner of private company build by using those ICO funds are saying there are no 42 mln $ ? So from where that 42 mln $  thing came? Noone is talking about who sold and what peak or whatever.We are talking about the ICO funds that were at the time of collecting equal to 42mln$. Team keeping the ICO funds in crypto for wanting to make more money for personal gains only adds to their scam. Now the same old founders who took the money and disappeared came back yesterday.Voronkov and Ponomarev. The ones that noone heard of for 2 years.Isnt that something? Never forget that the main people who did this scam were Igor Lebedev and Alexei Antonov. The first is a proud owner of RAYS and plays the victim role of : i was just an employee ,CEO title doesnt matter, i was just following orders... The other went into hidding for months now.... All the talk now is another way of throwing dust in the eyes of the investors, to take the attention of the fact that they exit scammed. Now we gonna play  the survivor,messiah role to resurrect Sonm from the ashes....DAO of nothing.Give me a break... But please go on, Sonm is the best comedy show on the blockchain after Bitconnect.",neg
This scam has gone way too far... Now messiah voronkov appeared to save the scam after he already got millions from sonm... Antonov got millions... CEO igor lebedev got his own private company built from our sonm ICO funds. And they still play the victims... People who fall for this deserved to be scammed now!,neg
"You were founder ,you received money from Antonov to leave in order for him to take control. Doesnt matter if they gave you millions of $ or millions of SNM tokens. You took the money without doing anything .You didnt even went public and explained why you left sonm and what was the situation. Now two years later you come and say 2 mln snm.Are you sure that it was 2 mln SNM or 2 mln $? We must believe you cause you say so? Now you come 2 years later and play innocent? You were founder of 42 mln $ scam .You took money from the ICO.You are part of it period. Like it or not thats the facts.  So go ahead .Tell us who owned Sonm company at pre -ico and ico times?Who funded the ICO campaign? Who gave you money for that shiny office? What happened after the ICO?Why all the original founders left and Antonov had to become all of a sudden ""founder"" ? Was there any agreement about the 10% team tokens and the 9% so called community growth tokens? You should have answered all those questions right after you left not now when everyone is starting to see what scam Sonm was.  PS you said i wanted to make voronkov ventures in DECEMBER 2017.Wasnt the SNM ICO summer of 2017? What happened those months? And werent you the same guy that said right after the ICO in one of the chats something in the line of: now i have money for everything,cars,whores,cocaine, time to party i made it?  Go ahead lie more....",neg

"   Waves is run exactly the same way. Please don’t be fooled again. Sonm only spent 3 mil on the development, the rest is stolen by the original founders. All these ico’s connected with icopromo are shady and should not be interfered with. We all lost on this SONM scam. Also IO has spent development funds on his now private company Rays which does not owe anything to the sonm community. IO acted as CEO, however he was just a puppet hired and given a budget to act as CEO but no control over any ICO funds. He claims ICO and sonm company which he ran are completely different, and his company got funds from ico wallet, but this has been only 3 million USD. So 39 MILLION has been scammed here. One of the biggest ICO scams in history. I don’t know if Ponomarev, Aleksei or the other CLOWN has these ICO funds stolen. I hope justice will victory and these clowns will get locked up for life. Many victims here and these russian scam artists just pretend nothing happened. They just create a NEW PROJECT funds with SONM ICO funds, moonshard.io and algalon.com. DONT INVEST OR GET ANYWHERE NEAR THESE NEW SCAM PROJECTS.",neg
"   Yea Unexpected exit scam, too bad SNM project had much potential to reach top 20-30 coins by marketcap but the greed got them to exit with ICO fund of investors, i dumped my small bag few hours ago and thanks god i didnt invested too much in SNM I think they exit with more than $30Million without counting team was dumping more than 44 million token during months since price was above 1500 satoshi and that is reason who makes price go under 100 satoshi in my opinion Me too i noticed that all Russians coins ended like this by exit scam and i hope WAVES will not do the same, Investment in crypto project became more scary..... in blink of eye the project turn from legit to scam and you end up holding token worth nothing.",neg
"   This is just another example of giving money to developers that know absolutely nothing about running a business, SONM is one project I was greatly bullish on for some time until I lost money but sold last year.

By the way he now calls himself MAINTAINER of SONM as a community member.Whatever that means.... He said that there is no longer sonm team, funding or whatever... As of today there is no more SONM company And another interesting thing is that he said that he OWNS RAYS. Anyone who cared to listen and read all the red flags i posted here since early November 2018 expected that to happen. For the others that thought and believed the team that i was just a fudder and troll i just laugh at your face. Good luck holding tokens of a company that doesnt exist .  HA HA HA",neg

Now they say : he lied the team  wont run any nodes Ofcourse you wont cause there are no money to be made for you by running them. Also you saying "" team wont run nodes"" doesnt mean shit.Noone knows who gonna run those nodes. RAYS is just another fail and money laundering like everything you did so far. You are implementing MN on a complete dead platform and there are still idiots who buy that stuff...  Again why there is no info about RAYS usage? Metrics, unique clients who used the fiatgate, gpu hours paid, profit so far, how many tokens team bought from Binance and burned lol You were shouting RAYS RAYS RAYS for months like some magical unicorn that somehow gonna save Sonm and now when it is live for weeks you are not giving any info about how it perform   Why hashrate dropped 4 times since live net? Where are the 800 registered RAYS users that were using it ? Why you changed the design of the system against what it was presented in the WP? Why now suppliers are not mining on SNM but mine for themself when there are no task? Why there is no mention about that fundamental change to the system in any of the reports?

NO Does anyone stayed using  it for more than 2 weeks? No Does it have marketing ? NO Now they will implement masternodes for completely dead product and will say: Here we delivered the MN too  In the end it is : take it or leave it ,we dont care cause ICO participants were donators.

What happened? Another scam and money laundering by the team... They gave tens of millions of tokens to the suppliers that instantly sent them to Binance and everyone can check that.

So can you tell from where that Masternodes gonna make profit lol Masternodes are just a cool long forgotten shill method from 2017. Binance and loom integration were never needed in the first place. For the purpose of binance integration they gonna use Loom.Thats the only connection between Sonm and Loom. And the reason for all that talk and work is that they are afraid that Binance can delist Snm at any moment and with that the price will go to 10 sats.Thats why they work on Binance Dex and that wont help bring clients to sonm one bit. You talk about 800 renders rendering on Sonm with examples  right? lol So RAYS is live now.Can you tell me what is the daily turnover there? How many clients are there, how much they have spent to render? Ofcourse you cant lol The only reason for SNM price to increase last year was and will be pump groups picking it next.

So they have an investor that supposedly pays all current project expenses right? SO WHY THE HELL TEAM IS USING SONM TOKENS TO PAY FOR SUBSIDIZING THE SUPPLIERS FOR RAYS?  They used the money that was supposed to be for Sonm development to create private company,to fund the desired hashrate using team controlled tokens and now they say ""we have the investor""....

"Check how suppliers or the team is sending millions of SNM tokens almost daily from the sidechain to Binance.

They took 42 mln $ and 19% of the tokens and created a marketplace that has no users,has no funding, has no marketing, has no future.That marketplace is not usable by anyone than Sonm team because first it is incredibly bad designed and unfriendly and second most important one is that no ordinary company or user will be able to compete for the resources, cause it will have a competition in the face of RAYS ( sonm team) that is paying much above the mining price ,so it kills every possible competition by others. Rays ( Sonm team) is able to do that cause they use ICO funding.They created private company RAYS with Sonm ICO funding that is using Sonm marketplace and paying for resources with ICO funding. For more than 1 year there is no company that had used the marketplace for more than couple of weeks.Now with the introducing of RAYS and the fact that it will pay much much more than the standard mining price, there will be completely no other user in the marketplace period.They said: our job is done,we created a marketplace ,our mission is over.Now we are working on our private projects. They used 42mln$ and 19% of the tokens to create a ghost town marketplace that has 0 users, they created a private company with ICO fundings, that is paying for resources with SNM tokens from the ICO and that is not accepting SNM as payment. There are just couple of days till the start of RAYS and there is 0 info about the token burning and the buying of tokens from binance and i will tell you why. Team still has tens of millions SNM.They will never buy tokens on Binance.They will show token transfers from Binance to sidechain but those tokens will not be bought on the exchange but just transfered from their Binance wallets.You will never know what is RAYS profit so that 70% burn they are telling you about is worthless.It comes to what number they throw at you and you as good blind sheeple gonna be happy.They will continue to dump tokens to suppliers , suppliers will continue to dump tokens on Binance while noone will be buying on  exchange cause the so called ""clients "" gonna be buying directly in RAYS with fiat.... This is a dead spiral and price just doesnt have reason to increase .Team has no motivation to work for higher price cause their profit is not connected with SNM token... Where are your Masternodes,where are your block producing nodes,where are the users of sonm marketplace,where are the turnovers,where are the deals, where is the promotion of Sonm,where are the bots fighting for resources ? Where are your money ? Anyone is free to check my post history.I warned you about Sonm team since November 2018....

"Where i said anything about wanting them to make me millionaire? All i wanted is not to be 10x down in $ and 36x down in BTC. If you dont know Sonm investors dream is the ICO price. Sonm is the only project that did an ICO in the golden crypto times of summer 2017, who collected tens of millions of dollars, that never even reached its ICO price.Not talking about being in profit.... Sonm is the biggest crypto failure when it comes down to market cap and price and thats the facts. And that is all because of team actions. All other talk about product ,technology ,team, progress are only empty words with no results. Two years later there is nothing... Now price is not going down cause someone is buying only  to sell the ""so called news"" about Rays or Binance integration . Thats the reason this isnt yet under 100 sats.But you gonna see , Rays is coming in weeks and mark my words you wont see anything different cause Sonm in particular Rays is a private company now, designed and working only to fill team bank accounts.  And BTW this is what they said after the ICO finished. Read it carefully and laugh with me:  The ICO included a progressive bonus structure for the first 80% of tokens sold. The funds will be distributed as follows: 33% for marketing promotion, market growth, community and expansion; 30% for research and development; 20% for the original SONM team; 7% for complementary technologies; 6% for technology infrastructure; and the remaining 4% for indirect costs such as legal and office expenses.  “Following the impressive success of its ICO, which attracted an extraordinary level of interest from investors, I trust SONM will quickly establish itself as a leader and innovator in the distributed computing market,” said Jaron Lukasiewicz, a SONM advisory board member who was CEO of the Coinsetter and Cavirtex exchanges that Kraken acquired.  Besides Lukasiewicz, the board of advisors includes Lisk CEO and President of the Lisk Foundation Max Kordek, and ChronoBank CEO Sergei Sergienko.  Scammer next to  scammer beside scammer, all lined up. This part is extremely epic: The funds will be distributed as follows: 33% for marketing promotion, market growth, community and expansion  33% for marketing ,market growth and community.

"I had an intention to stop posting here, but team officials are calling me troll so i will keep going instead. Like always team ignores and doesnt comment on any of the facts they dont like. That has been proven in the years.Last post  shows the same pattern. About MN .I asked : ""Or you are saying that everyone will be able to run whatever node they want with no requirements? lol "" About the suppliers dumping.They asked me for examples. Did i provide examples? I showed 2 suppliers addresses that clearly shows that the moment they get SNM tokens as a payment they instantly are sending them to Binance. Everyone can check it.And it is not only those two.Most of the addresses i checked are doing the same thing. Thats why i said 95% giving some the benefit of the doubt.Still everyone can go and look into the sidechain and the suppliers. But  did the team comment on those examples they were so eager to be shown? Ofcourse not cause there have nothing to say when they are faced with concrete facts. About team sending 40 million SNM on Binance and the timing on that overlays big dump of SNM tokens . Again everyone can check that.Check the dates ,check Binance. COINCIDENCE ?  LOL They said we sent them to Binance cause we dont want anyone to be able to look into our transactions. BUT BUT BUT that is one of the greatest advantages of Crypto in general. The transparency of the blockchain is one of the main things that attracted many people. Still it is not good for Sonm team cause SHADY is their second name. They have been shady from the pre ico and still 2 years later they are doing shady things. And BTW those 9% tokens were called "" COMMUNITY GROWTH TOKENS"". Sonm team as a special and unique one is GROWING THE COMMUNITY BY SENDING THE TOKENS TO BINANCE. They say we create ""real life company"" Rays Render. But lets think on what cost? Lets look at some angles.First they are saying that their job with Sonm is done. That ""they delivered what they promised in the WP"". White paper that was DELETED.Still they delivered a platform that 2 years + from the start has no users.YES ZERO COMPANIES ARE USING SONM PLATFORM AT THE MOMENT. Yet they dont see a problem with that. They are traded on only one exchange. They dont see a problem with that. They used SONM ICO money,Sonm team payed by SONM ICO money, SONM platform created by SONM ICO money to make a PRIVATE COMPANY called RAYS RENDER THAT DOESNT ACCEPT SNM TOKEN AS A PAYMENT. And they say: maybe later some other company will accept SNM tokens as a payment   Imagine how arrogant they are. SONM TEAM DOESNT EVEN WANT AND ACCEPT THEIR OWN TOKEN AND EXPECT AND HOPE SOMEONE ELSE TO DO THE JOB FOR THEM LOL And yet YOU are holding and buying a token that its own team doesnt give a flying f about the price. Example .For 2 years and 42 mln funding team managed to get only one decent exchange and they got listed on Binance only because community vote. Can you name another project with so much funding that did that? They have constantly one of the lowest volumes on Binance.Constantly under the threat of delisting.Does the team care?Ofcourse not. CAUSE SNM TOKENS ARE AN ISSUE FOR THEM.They are all about the fiat. They dont see a problem with having 5 BTC volume and having hundreds of thousand SNM daily pressure by the miners. This token is on life support,on command breathing and the market is showing it.There are no new investors,there are no traders, no whales interested, even the pump group wont touch this shit anymore when they saw that there is a team that is dumping millions of tokens on every pump chance. The only Sonm founder who is left is running bots on Sonm market from the start .He is the one controlling the price ,pumping and dumping it when he likes.Thats why noone will touch this shit.Yes if thats new info for you .The guy that controls SONM is running bots on the market . And you wonder why the price of SNM token is so rekt and who has the bag to dump millions of tokens on every pump group attempt. Mastenodes and Block producing nodes are a scam. They were marketing stunt,last resort to pump  the price pre live net. First you will never be able to freely run a node. Team said it directly: TEAM GONNA RUN NODES. Let me ask those who are not on the team ""blind sheeple groupie"".Do you really think with the history of Sonm team and the fact that they were all take and take and grab as much money as they can that they will let NOONES taking money from them? Why there is 0 and i repeat ZERO marketing of Sonm since last summer.There is no effort to promote Sonm marketplace ,to attract new investors, to get the attention of the crypto community.And now they are saying directly that their job with Sonm is done and you are free to use it. You invested in Sonm ICO to be able to use it in the end .To be DEVS and to use the supercomputer lol.Now you are free to do it ... Team never ever said that they see a problem with SNM price being down 37 times BTC from the ICO. YES THE ICO PRICE WAS 5000 sats and yet there are still sheeple that are buying their words. You can check my post history and see that i was talking how Sonm will perform in the future starting from last November. Check the price at that time.Check what i have said and if i wasnt correct about my prediction. Sonm is done.Now they are creating and working on private companies based on Sonm that are not accepting SNM as payment. Yes SNM token will still be used to pay to the miners but it doesnt mean anything.Tokenomics is totally broken.There is noone holding or have a reason to buy cause you cant spent it anywhere.Dont buy their lies anymore. It has been all lies for 2 years. SNM is the worst performing project that had so much funding and it is all because the actions of the team. They never ever cared about the price of the token and used it only for trading and dumping on exhanges and after livenet when people saw with their own eyes that it was all lies team is trying to get rid of as much of their holdings as they can dumping on every pump attempt. When they got 42mln $ crypto was good.Now it is really bad for them.They got 42mln to create a working product with adoption,users and turnover. They created a ghost town with no users and now they say: our job is done we are working on our own private projects. If that is not arrogant /spit in the face behavior i dont know what is. If you are still believer ask yourself this: Why would you buy or hold a token that can not be used for anything or accepted by anyone?",neg
"Cut your losses guys, this is a scam project.  Read my post history, I was a complete believer of this project until I woke up and realised how deluded I was.  Glad I sold around the 30-40 cent region and have never looked back. Though, I do admit, I do tend to come back just to see what the price is. I won't lie it can be rather amusing.  This is one of the first projects I invested in back in 2017 but the experience was a good one as it let me understand how worthless and scammy these projects really are.  If you don't know this now, then you'll realise in the next 24 months when this coin pretty much goes to zero.  Good luck and remember, PROTECT your capital!",neg
"First of all you demanding anything is hilarious. Where were you when i asked the team to comment to any of my tens and tens of messages?  About the MN and BPN.The information is from telegram rooms. Sadly i can not present it cause i have been banned from every sonm room.When you dont clap your hands at the team you get banned. On that topic.It was said that running a MN or BPN will require some form of verification ( something like KYC), the same way SONM is using KYC now for suppliers if im not mistaken.Im saying all of that just to show to the masses that even if you have 100k or 500k SNM you are not guarantee that you will be able to run a node on SONM and get that ROI.Most probably you wont be approved and team will run the nodes themself and not give out money. Or you are saying that everyone will be able to run whatever node they want with no requirements? lol ---------------------- About the tokens that was sent to Binance and than dumped. Everyone who follows SONM knows about that the team officially controlled 9% community growth tokens and 10% team tokens.Thats on paper. The 9% community tokens are gone.40 million SNM tokens were send to Binance. You can find the address check the history. They were send in a time frame of few months.The timing most of the time was overlaying the times when pump groups have choose SONM token for pump.On each pump last months someone was constanly dumping milions and millions of tokens supressing the growth of the price.It wasnt one ,two or three times.Multiple times on every pump.Thats why SONM price never ever was able to get some higher ground when pump groups picked Sonm. Simple question WHY TEAM WOULD MOVE 40 MILLION TOKENS TO BINANCE WHEN THEY WERE SITTING IN THE 9% COMMUNITY GROWTH ADDRESS FOR 2 YEARS? And who sold tens of millions on tokens the exact times those tokens were moved to Binance? ------------------------------------ About the suppliers dumping the tokens they receive on Binance. Since the start of the reward program team has send multiple time millions of tokens to the sidechain. At the moment in the sidechain there are 8 436 000 SNM. If you look at the address that had 10% team tokens: https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf6dc72878810f0fb7fbe65105a357ce9f2250dd9#pageSize=100 You gonna see that there are now only 30 million tokens from 44 million. 14 million SNM were sent from that address to the sidechain. At the sidechain at the moment there are 8 436 000 tokens. Take in mind that there were tokens in the sidechain before may too.You see the difference in the numbers? Where all that difference went you gonna say? The answer is suppliers that take their 2x reward are instantly sending their SNM tokens to Binance and selling them. You want examples you said ? Here is : https://ethplorer.io/address/0xaa2f73ff8350f0da5f013ac2318cc73ee3ed030f#pageSize=100 The moment supplier recieves his reward the very same moment there is the transaction to Binance. What about this one? https://ethplorer.io/address/0x78e9258c2689953237d1da5f5c2bb4a2a153d031#pageSize=100 And you say suppliers hold? You are dumping your tokens to supplies giving them 2x + rewards .Thats free 100% bonus money to the suppliers that is coming from SNM tokens. You are creating constant daily sell pressure ,but why you would care about it when you dont give a shit about the price of you own token....  Still waiting for the answer.Why SONM TEAM DOESNT ACCEPT THEIR OWN TOKEN AS A PAYMENT ?",neg
"If everything is so great,team is so great, product is so great , vision and strategy is so great. Have you ever asked yourself why Sonm is one of the biggest failures from the crypto projects that did ICO at summer 2017? They are still top 50 for biggest ICO funding. Have you ever asked yourself why or you are too stupid to do it? Can you name a single project that collected tens of millions of $ that never hit their ICO price of 5000 sats and at the moment their ICO investors are down 33 times in terms of BTC?",neg
"I have read it ofcourse. I dont just spew nonsense out of nowhere. I just wonder if you dont mention anywhere that RAYS is connected with SONM?How RAYS gonna promote SONM? How crypto investors gonna know about that amazing creation based on Sonm and than get interested and invest in Sonm? Wasnt it supposed to be the opposite?RAYS being the first real product ,the flagship of SONM... It is pretty obvious what the team is trying to do... Information about tokenomics you say? I see only ""in the future"" "" in the near future"" type of stuff. The same stuff we have heard for 1.5 years now. How many times you have changed your roadmap? 6 or more? What is the guarantee that in the few months you wont produce new roadmap? Everyone can produce roadmaps.The thing is to follow them. What about the latest roadmap based on which the MN should have already be implemented. You scammed everyone into buying Masternodes and Block producing nodes and than it is ""always in the near future mode"" Another thing is that even if you have 100k or 500k SNM you are not guarantee to be able to run a node.. You must be approved /KYC by SNM team and if only they let you , you gonna receive that 10-15% ROI from whatever.... Guess if the team gonna give money to some randoms and not run the nodes by themself lol Why you abandoned all the SONM promotion after livenet? And the most important question is .... If SNM token is so so so so important for the team why in the last 2 months team sold tens of millions of the tokens their control and why SNM holders cant use SNM token on RAYS if like you say SNM token is the foundation of it all? Even you as the team dont want to accept your own token as a payment... And ofcourse now you will come with: it will be done in the future... We have heard IN THE FUTURE countless time. The results and the facts are out there.Team sold tens of millions of tokens at 2c a piece.Team dont even accept SNM token as a payment. Team already stated: WE DELIVERED EVERYTHING WE  PROMISED IN THE ICO.OUR MISSION IS DONE.SONM IS A PRIVATE COMPANY NOW.  Case closed.It was obvious since last summer that Sonm was well disguised scam.They knew from the start that their profit will come in the form of fiat and used the tokens they controlled for insider trading,pump and dumps.And since livenet when everybody saw that everything was just blatant promises and lies they stopped any promotion and just started to dump their tokens on every pump organised by some pump group.Thats why Sonm price is constant downhill. Simple explanation.Team never cared, dont want and dont need SNM token.Thats why RAYS takes only FIAT as payment.And team is dumping millions of tokens to the suppliers giving them 2x mining rewards.And 95% of the suppliers are instant sending the SNM they receive to Binance to dump them.Whoever cant see that is just....",neg
" I know that RAYS runs on SONM.Im not asking if it runs or not... Im asking why nowhere on the RAYS page there is not a single mention about SONM and that RAYS is using SONM? Why team officials are saying that RAYS is a private independent company ,when it is using SNM tokens to pay the suppliers? Why team hide like pedophile priest the connection between RAYS and SONM? Why there is zero marketing about SONM anymore?  I can tell you why...Cause team doesnt need,doesnt care and doesnt want SNM tokens. They are all about that fiat payments that will be coming in RAYS.  The clear example is that RAYS which is build on SONM,with the funding from SONM ICO,from the team that is payed by the money from SONM ICO.In the very same RAYS you can not use your SNM tokens to do rendering. Even the team doesnt want their OWN TOKENS.They will gladly take your FIAT money for the rendering, but they dont accept SNM tokens as a payment.  Need to say more?  I dont think anyone with a half brain would need more,but i know that there are alot of them here ,so i can continue...",neg

If you find that something of that is not true ,please post the information here and will apologise in a heart beat.

"You are bunch of id..ts.You have no idea what is going on, why the hashrate increased,why deals increased, whatever.... You dont even know that the team dumped 9% of the total tokens on Binance in the last month... You dont even know that the team is using  their 10% of the tokens to pay for the elevated rewards to the miners. Team is getting rid of their tokens at 3cents cause they know that SNM token has no real value and usage and will never grow. They take fiat payment and they pay to the miners from their own tokens and team has close to 100 million SONM more. Than the miners are going on Binance and selling Sonm,team dumps as much of their tokens on every pump ... There is just huge constant selling pressure and no buying.Especially now when every potential client will use the FIAT GATE and will never buy the tokens they need on the exchanges.

"     Funny how he hasnt posted since ""the most hard working devs"" already failed to deliver from the Q4 roadmap... So that argument is already gone.Also i have heard this expression "" the most hard working devs"" . Let me think....In almost every crypto project subforum ,slack,telegram, reddit. CTO gave deadline mid November for the new Whitepaper.Check on that too. Thats just from the latest pile of....But but but thats why you will never read in the monthly report about any of that, wont read about any of the important marketplace stats like hashrate,customers,turnover,locked tokens in the sidechain... You may read the usual Borat line: great success .Or how there is new russian company called ""Nu Pogodi"" using the marketplace. Imagine a project that has collected 42 million $ and is 26th largest ICO of all time, has 4-5 people that are hired just to look 24/7 at the telegram rooms and forums.Just to keep the community in check.Pure communist type of doing propaganda. They have people getting salary only to sit and browse constantly the forums and telegram, to ban people ,to keep the sheeple in line.They act usually within a minute on telegram .If you look at this thread you will find many responses from team officials but somehow when some evil guy started posting what is the real picture behind SNM they just dissapeared .Same way as the CEO is nowhere to be found,same way the CTO started acting and people starting to ask where is our cult leader. The paid telegram admins were so active here,still are 24/7 on telegram and reddit, but cant be seen here Wonder why?Cause they just have nothing to say...They cant ban me like they banned hundreds of people on telegram who dared to say something different than praise Putin,praise Snm,praise Lebedev... Funny thing that shows how pathetic they are is that they sent mails to bitcointalk ,asking them to ban me. That was said by the head of community management and communication or whatever its called. Imagine how desperate they were trying to contain and hide the real truth about their clown show... The result of 42 000 000 $ funding is 50$ a day product  ",neg

During the time Bitconnect, Regalcoin, Davorcoin etc are experiencing a huge dump, this one with same ideology and modus operandi sprung up with name similar to other multiple e tokens of late 2017. What really made investors think that this would be any different from other lending platforms? They have all been confirmed a ponzi scheme and all ponzi schemes at some point will surely run out of funds to pay the participants.

This is a scam on website says raised $40 million no chance clearly lies.  Daylight roberry!!!!",neg
   From what I gather it was some guys running this from India.  Couple of Indian ladies were promoting this so hard they were taking money of punters.  I knew it was lies and told them this as well.  While they made a killing but ripped other people off!! SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!,neg
Yes its scam..I couldnt get tokens and sell them as they disable withdraw long time ago. There was 2 place where they sold tokens and they are not sending in to members that buy. I buy in novembar and now cant login. Support not answering but promotional e mails sending all the time. 😀😀,neg

"Any signs of life in this project? It seems this project is not evolving as aspected.... Asking critic questions about a transfer of 875k CH tokens which were dumped in february far below market price (around 0.0006 Waves per token), led to a block in the Telegram group...  Transaction of the 875k CH tokens:   Github last commit 4 dec 2017:  That is over 5 months..... What is progress so far?",neg
"  Yes the crowdsale is until the end of this month. Since the beginning of the sale, the tokens have been offered with increasing prices in various trade pairs on the Waves DEX. Sales have been stagnating since the end of February. The token is now offered by Coinhealth in only one trade pair. The team seems to have been inactive since March.  In the telegram group I asked where the 875k tokens came from, why they were dumped, was the team responsible for this and whether the number of 2k offered by Albegro each time came from them? Through Wavesdesk I have seen the transactions from the Coinhealth address to Abrego and also the 875k tokens.  For this I was banned from the group. Via DM I contacted the ""Ghost Admin"" of the group. Here it seemed that I had to prove the justice of my questions just as I am in possession of CoinHealth tokens. That admin said also you have no economic knowledge and therefore you do not understand and in another messages was said that the team has bought up tokens.  I own nearly 30k Coinhealth tokens and have over 250Waves in it. So it seems to me that I can look very critically curious about the project. Not that someone who is upset, because the progress of the crowdsale does not go as expected, the project stops and goes on vacation of my money .....  Now I try to contact by this topic and twitter channels to get in touch with them. My confidence in this project is decreasing considerably last weeks.......  Edit: This the waves address from the 875k dumper: 3P5M6JHqrdZNfK7n6wdurm2BtcUyVKWukSn CoinHealth's Waves address: ",neg
"I messaged Coinhealth and their known employees by Twitter, reffered to this topic and waiting for an answer!!!!  Waiting for an answer minds me of a quote from Frank ""The Punisher"" Castle (©Marvel):    CoinHealth it is up to you to prove me: i am completly wrong, the project is alive and kickin' or even buy my tokens back instead collecting the funds and ledding the project into a silence death.....",neg
"Just for the sake of clarity I do not take any action to undermine the project or create FUD. My critical posts also have nothing to do with the current disappointing market (which has a price fall of> 50% compared to December 2017), which hinders the current value of a CoinHealth token and that makes me an angry consumer as by Ghost Admin of the telegram group in DM continues to occur.  The ico's I've participated in I see all as (mid-) long-term investments and I place CoinHealth under it. The ico's are: Bankera, Astronaut, Credits, Change Bank, Coffeecoin, Oceanlab and a few other ones that I forget.  No I am critical because of the inactivity of the team on social media, the lack of marketing by, for example, an airdrop to attract potential new investors and communicating the technical project developments and / or entering into contractual business relations to the project in the directer future.   However, I have noticed that the previous ico price on the Waves DEX has been lowered by Coinhealth from 0.083Waves to 0.039Waves per CoinHealth token.  Why is nothing communicated about this on social media? What is the reason for the price reduction? Why has the team still not reacted in this topic?  Ghost Admin is aware of this topic. He / she has received the link. Ignoring my questions or that the team keeps hiding and being accused of not understanding makes me only more pissed!  It is up to CoinHealth to remedy this. Because of our money, your (our) project becomes possible and here we all hope to become wiser in the longer term.  I hope that my posts encourage the team to continue, communicate transparently with the supporters, follow the road map and deliver what has been reflected in the white papers.  So therefore again for the sake of clarity: If I am wrong, then I am really not the worst to admit it.",neg
"Ok the heat is on bastards! These coinhealth MOFO's reported my twitter messages with the link to this topic as spam. Result my twitter account is suspended by this.  Coinhealth team is this the way you thread early investors and people who trust you their money to start your project? Why are you hiding and not reacting in this topic?  Of the 200mln tokens there are only 7.5mln sold so far.... Is this the reason why the team is hiding, not posting updates and stopped their activities on social media?  By hiding and be silence i assume all my found results are true and this project works one way ---> your way by collecting money and do nothing as was promised in the white papers!",neg

Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:38]   Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:38] 10 dec. 2017 875k units... these units are dumped in march  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:40] trade history:   Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:41] mail send to contact@coinhealth.io... mail were bounced  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:42] twitter relocated to:   Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:42] so what do i wrong?  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:45] You are making false staements. You are highlighting an address that isnt CH the company and claiming the company dumped 800k tokens , completely false I asked to verify your Waves wallet address to verify your purchases have come from CH.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:46] where did the 875k units from? they came from coinhealth to the address which dumped them.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:47] The twitter is the CEO's old one try coinhealth1 on twitter. Contact@coinhealth.io may have bounced. It became a spam box for all the scum in the industry to send their crap. So we closed it.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:47] Show me this transaction  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:49] Also at one time all tokens came from CH what members do with them is up to them. The team is on contract and cant sell.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:50] i asked for answers and did not acuse anyone...  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:52] You made accusations that a team member dumped 800k tokens , completely false.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:52] if the twitter and email address does not work then it makes sense that I ask questions about this?  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:53] You accused Abrego of selling tokens which he can because hes not on contract hes a bounty manager.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:54] You stated there is no social sites , incorrect we have twitter, fb, insta, reddit, tumbler, bitcointalk. and about 5 others  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:54] It was very coincidental that Arbegro was mentioned on twitter and the day after suddenly offered 2000 units for sale.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:54] You cant market on any of them or google adwords because of new regulation  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:54]   Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:55] 25% of token ....  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:55] Listen we all know the market sucks, but being a hysterical consumer isnt the way to handle it.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:56] Abrego is able to do what he wants with his tokens he isnt on a contract  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:57] One of our largest token holders has 25 million and hasnt sold a token.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:57] The ceo hasnt sold a token.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 00:57] and the CEO isnt the largest token holder.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 00:58] the TX don't lie....  the transaction says: 25% .... where did they come from? not from me  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:01] Wow you have no understanding of this do you. The tokens at one time came from CH . In the TX does it say how they were afforded. No it doesnt thats what you dont know.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:01] what has changed with the regulation? why did CH choose this design for the ico? why do I see little progress in marketing and so on? can you imagine why I have these questions? No, that is not because the market is against it ... no because I have the impression that an attempt was made to pick up more by means of a detour because a wrong ico structure was  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:02] once again unfounded accusations  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:02] you cant market in social media anymore for one , google adwords doesnt allow it either.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:03] maybe if you understood market econ , you might understand that 90% of all tokens are down over 75%. Not just CH  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:03] is the ico listed on coinschedule.com or other ico sites?  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:04] yeah about 40, coinschedule we no longer use. But were on there for 2 months, they have gotten far too expensive.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:05] it is a pity that you are attacking me now and do not enter into content questions.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:06] okay .... what are the current developments and what can we expect in the short term?  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:07] Im not attacking you , but its clear you dont know what your talking about. Why dont you point out that the company has bought back 100's of thousands of token peopke dumped?  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:08] The beta was about ro be released 3 weeks ago but we had a glitch with two opperating systems we are now fixing.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:08] lol obviously you wont point that out  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:09] if I do not understand it all ... explain it to me in a very simple way instead of the way you respond to it  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:10] Also until you verify you actually hold 30k tokens like you said by posting you address. Im a little over your accusations. And answering any of your questions.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:11] see me as first time costumer and convince me to buy tokens  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:12] Very simply put , what backs CH? BTC,LTC,ETH, Waves where are they? over 75% down . Its a massive flow pool.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:13] if everything is 75% less than it is in fiat seen the best to step in. many coins for little  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:13] that is no reason for me that the ico remains behind  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:19] Ill tell you what since this is a long conversation lets schedule a time to speak. Ill call you through here. When would be good for you?  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:20] Because you dont understand economics that why.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:22] it is a shame that it is all up to me or the market that is down .... I use google translate because I am not English speaking so calling does not make sense.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:23] my conclusion is that the 875k units have completely annihilated the ico! if they are earned with something why are they not released until the end of the ico?  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:27] this conversation did not lead to anything except that we both now think what a jerk is that guest is too bad about the way in which cryptoland reacts to each other. If someone is not at the same level, then economic knowledge is lacking. If there is something different, it is up to the market. if critical questions are asked, you first have to defend yourself as questioner or prove that you have tokens in your possession.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:28] What language do you speak? I speak a few.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:28] Dutch  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:29] Okay thats not one I speak.  Ghost Admin, [05.04.18 01:30] Ill type out the full scenario for you and explanation but its going to take time.  Casper SMS303, [05.04.18 01:30] ok no problem  Casper SMS303, [13.04.18 15:04] and.... do you have it?  Casper SMS303, [14.04.18 17:49] Still waiting for the full scenario....  Casper SMS303, [14.04.18 17:52] If CH have bought back lot of tokens they can buy mine's too ... i dont have faith in this project anymore...  Ghost Admin, [14.04.18 17:59] Place your tokens for sale, you are in full control of your tokens. We are not at your beckoned call as we have answered your questions. That is why our model is the way it is. At no point in time were you ever locked in and had no way out. You dont want the tokens anymore, sell them.  Casper SMS303, [14.04.18 18:00] I gave you my adrress to prove i have almost 30k ... but i am still waiting for the full scenario as you promised  Ghost Admin, [14.04.18 20:37] Let me ask you , you said you used 250 waves. Waves is sub 4 dollars usd. So should we as an ICO say we lost faith in the Waves token because when people invested in it was worth 12-15 dollars a token. No we cant, we have to accept that the tokens that were used to pay for CH were worth far more when invested. Just like CH is down all tokenage used to buy CH is dowb meaning the ICO is at the same loss as the purchaser reciprocally.  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:07] I messaged to the coinhealth twitter account yesterday and still waiting for an answer....  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:07] i also replied in the Bitcointalk topic and guess what.... NO RESPONSE!  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:08]   Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:13] I just checked the twitter , please show me what Coinhealth account you messaged. We do not have a message from you.  Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:13] our twitter is @coinhealth1  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:14] More and more I get the impression that funds have been raised, the enthusiasm for the crowdsal disappointment and since then the project has stopped. The elaboration of reactions on twitter and on bitcointalk feeds this feeling more and more. Do you understand why I have received antipathy against the whole project? All that nonsense that I am not an economist and therefore do not understand it can put you in your place where the sun will never shine. You do not treat investors like that.  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:16] i used that twitter address...  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:16] all replies can be posted in the bitcointalk topic...  Casper SMS303, [16.04.18 22:16] make it transaprant  Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:17] You make constant accusations that arent true. We as a team do not have to take that type of abuse. What you do not understand and which we have tried to explain. Is that you dont spend funds when they are at 1/4 value at the same rate you would when at full value. You may call the economics of how a project can be ran and afforded crap but its the truth.  Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:28] The value of any crypto participants used to buy CH is at a 75% loss in current markets. Its very simple $1000 in waves 2 months ago is $250 in waves now. The project then makes cut backs and postpones things until markets are more favorable to continue at budget.  Ghost Admin, [16.04.18 22:29] Without doing this the project runs the risk of insolvency because of the market downturn. Does that make sense?  Casper SMS303, [20.04.18 18:25] answer here: ;topic=2629209.0;num_replies=17  Casper SMS303, [20.04.18 18:32] be honest... THE TEAM MESSED UP THE ICO/CROWDSALE and tried to jump into the hype....  now the results are dissapointed the project seems to be on hold  Casper SMS303, [20.04.18 18:32] [In reply to Ghost Admin] i passed this station 2weeks ago.... i paid with with waves and if my tokens bought back it will be for the same amount of waves... so there is no lost... does make that any sense?  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 18:55] I have tried to explain this repeatedly.When you purchased with waves , what was the value of each wave?  Waves is down from 15 dollars to 5. So the crypto you paid with is at a loss.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 18:59] We didnt mess anything up , we slowed things down and are still ahead of schedule. Stop making accusation about the project that you dont have any factual information about. Currently today Dr. Johny Nobles is at the IBM blockchain conference speaking with reps about our project. We were in silicon valley 3 months ago doing the same. Were looking to hire 2 more developers as we speak to bring all dev together in the beta. I have been very nice about trying to explain all that is going on. I have also tried to help you understand that market economics play a huge part in a project. I wont continue to try to explain due to constant accusations.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:00] The waves you used to purchase are value at 1/3 of when you purchased. Thats a loss.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:00] For us.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:03] This is a 5 year project and you are complaining in the first couple months. It took BTC 8 years to have substantial value.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:03] Im sorry if you thought this was a get rich quick ICO, It was never advertised as that.  Ghost Admin, [20.04.18 19:04] And its healthcare which takes ample time.  Casper SMS303, [24.04.18 18:48] The crowdsale is ended and the big sell order of 10mln tokens are still there at the DEX. Why is nobody from the team reacting or posting updates in the Bitcointalk topic? Yeah ... you slowed things (everything) down and still try to gain more funds...",neg

"Yeah this is really vague. Your website suggests the coins are for this specific movie, and prior verbage in this thread suggests it's for future films as well. How are those funded? Are tokens liquidated to pay for films on secondary markets? Are they bought back from secondary markets with profits from the films? If the films are not profitable how are the losses socialized? This needs a ton more detail about the mechanics of the finance model. If it's just for this one film I think it will be a disaster because if you require people to get in to cryptos to view a film (requiring them to buy ""tickets"" with ether) that is likely going to be modest viewing audience anyway all you are doing is guaranteeing the film will fail financially because of the barrier to entry.  I'm not trying to troll you or be negative, but I feel at this point you are asking for way too much for investors without providing nearly enough details. Crowdfunding stuff is cool, but I think at this point you can't consider this anything more than a kickstarter and not really a prospectus for investors looking for return on their capital (and maybe that's okay for folks willing to ""donate"" to make some indy films).",neg

I realized this zeth. it's crap project with full of shit. Totally garbage project. At the end of the journey they will running with all of the amount. Please don't follow this one. ,neg
Hi. Something very quiet there was. That the topic is not interesting or anyone? Apparently the project is really dead,neg
"trash,as a new Ann,it's really bad ,I believe that no one would join this ICO",neg
Is this ANN thread? Why i didn't see anything? I suggest you to use Pre-ANN instead because this project seems unclear  ,neg
How to track the progress of ongoing crowdfunding how funds they have been raised so far. There is no info about that on official it force to create account there to let know about that.,neg
Hello PingPaid Team.   We cant find any information regarding your TEAM.  There are no links on your website or whitepaper that we can verify your team.  Can you please provide to the community?     Thank you.,neg
I cant understand how they can speak about market capitalization while ico starts  in the first of July and is still going? Isnt it a trickery?,neg
Hello Dev. Is there a time frame of the ICO or token sale?  There is no detailed roadmap on the announcement thread.,neg
By using a security scan barcode or QR will make it safe but the problem is whether anyone can use it especially from countries that are still lack of technology?,neg
"  good news, but the price is very low against the price of ico the price now in ForkDelta is 0.000015 ETH per 1 PPD token and the ICO price is 0.000873 ETH price ico 0.000873/ price forkdelta 0.000015= 58.2 tokens Stupid who sell with this price ",neg
   I don't know. If your platform has many features that are in itself needs a large amount of resources to make it work. The platform is already spreading itself thin. ETHA's solution to remittance focuses only on remittance and making sure the flow of money is smooth going to the fiat gateways. They are testing their platform in India soon.,neg
   How do you know it's an interesting project there is no information about it other then one big picture? Do you have something we dont'?,neg

"   Indeed, that point need to be clarified.",neg
"Very curious about this project. Their website looks so profesional but their ann so unprofesional It's really hard to hire someone and made a proper ann ? And you should up date it continiously, I thought it's a single line thread,but after scrolling down i found amother information.  And it is japanese coin ?  ",neg
    I agree he should hire someone. The dev won't make much from his ICO without a proper announcement post. The OP is one of the worst I have ever seen.,neg
"   I'm not part of the team but I saw the initial post was very poor so I took it on myself to reposted some of the info because I think this has a lot of potential.  I found on their page. And also found their Youtube channel just by a Google search. I've watched all their vlogs... they just added a new one today.   There are coding operation in rural Costa Rica with people from all over joining their team.  in vlog 4 that came out today, the main guy says  ""We do have a break-through technology and it's unique. We're the first ones to implement it. So we don't need to create this whole long build up. We're going kinda launch with a Bang and that's why we're documenting this (with the vlogs)...  and releasing it when we are ready to release it.",neg
It was tough for me to get any real info from the ANN. Is it on any exchanges yet? Any info on the development team and credentials?,neg

OP has the time to reply to easy comments but have no time to explain how Nimiq is going to stop miners from writing optimised C code to mine nimiq instead of depending on a browser.,neg
"  you are right, also if the browser just different in that name and dont have special feature, it means this browser just like another browser",neg
"    If they busy with testing the protocols, how they could be already made that   Think logic,",neg
"   I hope you know that, it's not real digging as of now ",neg
"   There are existing extensions for coins like Ethereum that does exactly the same, like Metamask. What would be the difference? Metamask harcoded to the blockchain, so what?  Just trying to get the vision behind the project.",neg
"Is there anything more known about going to the exchange and what the expected price will be to go for? I mean, I've checked Twitter, website and the pages here but couldn't find an answer for it. I am really curious about what to expect from this project trade-wise. I am willing to put effort into the project btw, I do a lot of design work and I am also doing some mining for it but I want to know if the amount I can mine with my desktop PC is worthy of the effort haha",neg
"   the one you mine right now just a test, worthless.  they going to have ico later on 22nd of June i think  join the Telegram more active over there if you have any questions",neg
"   Lol what? It's useless? How is that fair? I've been mining for a couple of days now, really harsh. My balance is now 1000 and is worth nothing? That can't be fair for the effort and time people have put into it.",neg
"Since I didn't get a satisfying answer to my question, let me ask it again: are the so called 'beta-coins' completely useless or what? I think it's fair that they represent some kind of value for the ICO's and what not. People spend time and effort into those. Well, at least I did.",neg
  Why would you do that? Everything that is being mined at this stage is appearantly useless. It has 0 value and all you have in your wallet will be reset before or during their ICO or something. So you are wasting your electricity power and hardware for nothing.,neg
   That's my concern. If websites start embedding the miner then I imagine popup blockers or even the browsers themselves will take steps to prevent the function of this coin. If the wallet/transaction system is separate that wouldn't be the worst thing. But if they aren't it'd remove the main purpose of the coin.,neg
"5% nimiq=60000eth?funny,i wouldn't like to invest in...",neg
   so I am not the only one feeling it is a bit pricey,neg
"If you mine, you get 50 nims. but if you invest you get 17.5 nims per eth. is it just me that I am feeling this is not a good deal. besides, what makes it worth 20 bucks per nim? I dont understand what those guys in Slack discussing?",neg
Is there any news regarding the launch of Nimiq? I haven't heard anything about it since the ICO some time ago,neg
"   I agree, Al. Deadlines and roadmaps are too often 'investor pressure.' I'd rather wait, and get a better product.",neg
"So the website was updated now Q1 2018 for mainnet, not December as it says in the title of this thread.    Watching the vlog did you ever see a more self-absorbed, out-of-touch group of people? It's all beards and bro-fisting, dizzy with conceit after all the millions they raised to support their new jet-set lifestyle, which is excessive and inessential to this kind of software project.    The reason for the delay? They want to give time for people to swap their coins. Bullshit! Q1 = 3 months. It won't take 3 months to do that. Eth is at all time high which means anyone who invested in Nimiq has lost big, while the money they took in the ICO just keeps growing like one big huge sushi plate.  Tezos is getting sued, other projects that break promises will follow.  Being a skateboarding hippy with your head up your ass won't protect you, nor will a Swiss foundation.",neg
"I just tested the new release of the testnet, I was impressed by how fast it is now to connect to the network.    The global hashrate and my personnal hashrate both decreased a lot. It's probably because they changed the algorithm. I dropped from 12 kH/s to 1 kH/s.  Also, the blocks seems to be heavier. I don't remember the blocks' size on the previous betanet, so if may be totally false, but currently an empty block is 555 bytes and a block with 4 transactions is more than 1 MB.  PS : the reward has dropped from 50 NET per block to 5 NET per block.",pos
   'their new jet-set lifestyle' What I see is guys lugging their own luggage on to a train.  But bro-fisting? OMG! tee hee It's got to stop!!,neg
So still just jungle mumbo jumbo at this project... Hope they will deliver something soon...,neg
I know I ranted about the ICO price but this project is a steal right now. Easy 10-xx bagger.,pos
  On github nimiq looks very good. Devs are working. But the price for net absolutely the same like on ico in $. On btc and eths it's low(,pos
"just bought some NET through etherdelta -- what a headache -- is there an easier, less error prone, way of buying it?",neg
"I would love to buy some NET.  However, I'd like to move it off the liqui.io exchange (for safety, one never knows...). How does that work? Is it even possible? Which wallet can I use? When the mainnet goes live, how is the NET converted to Nimiq?",neg
"I am not sure how this works but people create projects collect BTC, ETH from people with ICO which has start and end dates but Those people don't know when they will have the final product, NO ETA.  Just ridiculous.",neg
   Kickstarter. Just ridiculous.,neg
"Guys, I know they need positive posting from you, that's ok. But, based, tell me pls what are the perspectives for this project today? In addition, I cannot understand how the coin can be traded on some exchanges but still displays the notice ""your balances can be transformed to anything possible, like to nullm after the mainnet gets launched"". Mining it today is pointless under such conditions, right?",neg
  Anything concrete yet the conversion? Also: I'm concerned about giving personal information and ID to a party I don't know and is not a well known well secured exchange. Glad I didn't buy NET yet.,neg
Some might have been annoyed that KYC will be required to exchange NET to NIM.,neg
"   Whoa! Just 'KYC mandatory' doesn't cut it!  Okay, I got my NET as part of a group buy-in, so it's my lack of due diligence that got me here -- but it's also the case that the information on this project has been presented poorly.  So: 'We may determine . . . that it is necessary to obtain certain information . . . ' [  ]  This is fair enough for the early stages; but I've never heard of a dev team requiring KYC -- to trade on centralised exchanges, yes; but to own a crypto? No.  And I feel the following is disingenuous: '[KYC] only applies to the replacement of NET for NIM.' Once you've got out data, you've got our data . . .  My inclination is to sell my holdings forthwith. Goodness, I hope I've misinterpreted something here. What is 'KYC'? What data? Held by whom? Under what security protocols? For how long?",neg
"   Why do we need kyc? I don't understand that, the sale is already finished and you are just giving everyone with tokens in one account an equivalent in nimiq, there is no new value that gets generated etc.",neg
Nimiq won't transfer Net to Nim.  Sounds like a lawsuit.,neg
"KYC - Know your Customer, just google it...  so to get our NIM we have to send you our data?!  how is the network goin to work? .... ""sorry to create a wallet you need to send us your id"" ""sorry, please fill out these forms to participate in mining"" ""sorry, to collect your mined coins please fill out these forms and proove that you are allowed to circulate the coin""  i know you try to follow the rules ... and i understand that we dont want anyone here financing some terror and yes this is a browser based blockchain and no cryptocurrency but how is the service going to make up for the loss in financial freedom we get when sending our documents?  btw, thats why i advertise deeponion!",neg
"   Well, if this the case then this project is more than dead. The reason why crypto exists is because no one should control over our own money. But if i have to send my ID to you and fill out stupid things to mine and collect my money then why should i use your service? Not only do you have my ID and thats terrible enough but also you can control me and my money. No thanks.",neg
"  This is exactly what I think. Maybe my previous post was not very clear, but this one is a good summary of what I think about all this administrative problems.",neg
"   This is incorrect. To comply with regulation you have to do KYC to use our NET-to-NIM replacement tool. This doesn't mean you have to do KYC to create a wallet, send/receive NIM or to use any app from the Nimiq Ecosystem. If you join our community you'll find this project is far from dead",neg
"   Firstly, what documents and information constitute 'KYC'? When Bittrex launched an enhanced-verification project last year, they arrogantly assumed that their KYC processes encompassed every national-postal-address system on the planet. As a consequence, I experienced days of drama -- locked out of my account.  If 'KYC' remains a set of unknown documents/information, then where do I stand? Do I hold on to my tokens until the conversion begins, only to find that I am simply unable to 'KYC'?  Secondly, check the latest Vlog. A Nimiq team member is seen making little electronic hats for little electronic heads. Meanwhile, both this thread and the Reddit have token holders expressing concerns about losing their holdings -- ??",neg
"  KYC is the policy and trend that all governments use to ""protect"" people. I miss the old ""de-centralization""",neg
"   Your reply, nimiq, is polite. Thank you for that. But my concern remains: conversion approaches. You can't tell me what the KYC will involve. And I don't think the dev team has handled the issue at all well.  'Decentralization and KYC [are] non related matters.'        I'd like to go on the record: I agree with salary123: large numbers of people handing over data -- which we can only assume is being stored, and perhaps made available to government agencies -- may reasonably be seen as an instance of 'centralisation.'",neg
"   What about hacks?  And here's some insight into what 'KYC' might include: 'it is now commonplace for an individual to have to submit a passport scan, bank statement, and various other documents and to answer a string of questions about their background and the origin of their cryptocurrency.

Surely they didn't have KYC requirements while selling their ICO. They never disclosed that some countries would be excluded from receiving their promised product, but just as well took your money.

Quote from: polylogic on February 16, 2018, 01:52:42 AM 2. we call it exchange, i change my NET Token on Ethereum for NIM on Nimiq. (now i see both scenarios doesnt have to include kyc) --you really should have collected kyc at the net sale. do it now makes no sense whatsoever. because: Nimiq Network mainnet goes live. Nimiq Network continues to create NIM Coin, issued to miners (anonymous users of the nimiq network)  We couldn't have anticipated the current legal environment Blockchain projects are forced to deal with right now. But even though we didn't want to bother users with KYC last year during our Crowdsale, we still added this requirement in the terms you had to agree upon participating:  We may determine, for regulatory compliance purposes, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations in connection with accepting contributions to create and allocate NET to you or transfer NET to NIM. You agree to provide us such information promptly upon request.  i understand that is difficult times. but it doesnt look like you have the interrest of your investor in mind and only the success of Nimiq which of course means positive for investors. but like i said. we, the people that brought NET financed your way to Nimiq and now you say sorry some people cant be included in the success and yes nobody expected investor status by buying NET. but now you ask something very important and special which should be handled with up most care. personal data. the link which i quote said it very clearly. you cannot simply change your user id once its out in the open. you say its no problem with 3rd party providers? ..... but i get to this later.. lets stay on point...  if someone from the us invested in NET it should be his/her problem, not the problem on Nimiq. he/she is supposed to know that he/she is not allowed to invest in oversea projects. you cant be responsible for their action and for this dont have to put any borders on your crowdsale.  there is noone regulating the ico market and why should we let some rules from 2005 to fight terror and money laundering let dictate how this should be handled. its like i said. to comply with KYC requirements you will have to ASK EVERY USER FOR THEIR DATA not just NET2NIM people. why do you want our data? you maybe dont know it yet or you cant accept it, but google kyc, you will see.. once you go that route you cannot go back. im just trying to help.    Quote from: polylogic on February 16, 2018, 01:52:42 AM now if you say you can only exchange NIM for NET if we provide KYC ultimately means that in future you, HAVE TO get KYC from EACH and EVERY user of the NIMIQ Network because each address holds a share of the networks wealth. it can only be used if people provide kyc. simple as that. imagen you are the new visa, visa work without documents? no. No. We are only asking users to complete KYC in order to use NET-to-NIM replacement tool. That is all.  yes but why? i already told you why and you seem to ignore it. NIM issued by Nimiq Foundation, to use/sell/buy NIM you need kyc or you do not comply with kyc anymore. you ask some users but not others? how is this helping you or the users? it is not.   Quote from: polylogic on February 16, 2018, 01:52:42 AM kyc in this case is only a ""lets go the save route"" for current laws that dont apply to the situation, which may destroy your reputation.  KYC is required at this point to ensure the project complies with regulations in several countries, this is obviously required for our project to be a success which is ultimately our main goal.  this is actually not true and you cannot point me to some law stating that you are required to do that.   here are some ""guidelines"" on german -lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2005.309.01.0015.01.DEU good luck finding them in english because this doesnt seem to have an official number xD here is the AML/CFT file:  for US law..  i understand that you want the best for nimiq, but comply with kyc only for the Net2Nim doesnt make sense. it does mean that each wallet ""account"" created on Nimiq does need to be kyc compliant. why dont you do it like some other icos, put a limit for no kyc users. like max 5-10 ether or something. i really dont see myself selling my id to you for a 3 ether investment which doesnt provide me future shares or something...    Quote from: polylogic on February 16, 2018, 01:52:42 AM one of the biggest issue is that you want a 3rd party to controll the kyc data.  Using a 3rd party KYC provider is actually the safe a responsible way to go. no its not, its lazy, cheap, irresponsible and intolerable how can you guarantee for the safety of the data on a 3rd party server? how can you guarantee that this 3rd party doesnt steal or sell the data? how can you guarantee that the server of this 3rd party are not compromised? do you have any control over the data or the 3rd party company? i know everybody does this now.. but it doesnt make it right. paypal has my data, why dont you sell your NET or NIM with paypal?     Quote from: polylogic on February 16, 2018, 01:52:42 AM your security doesnt matter here. kyc data will be stolen or sold at one point in time.  Now this is just FUD and nonsense. We have carefully selected KYC providers than follow the most strict rules and security standards. This is a delicate part of the the process and of course we are taking it with all seriousness deserved by this matter.  -biggest-data-breaches-hacks/ yes its a little fuddy, but better be safe than sorry, people shouldnt play with their id. currently there are hacks which make every computer in this universe hackable and no patch will ever be able to fix it. you cannot guarantee for the safty of our data. this 3rd party created in 2010 and maybe vanishes in 2020 with millions of data from icos. its like i said, ask for kyc from all user or none... why presale only? please explain for people without knowlege about any of that.

We will not require origin of BTC or any other Crypto. We won't ask any background information to the users, only basic personal information. As I have stated before:  there is a misunderstanding.. i believe origin of btc and other crypto are requirements of AML/CFT. but this link has very important information for every user and i quote: It only takes one failure to expose an individual’s data once and for all time. Email and wallet addresses can be changed; passports and driving licenses are permanent  Quote from: Nimiq on February 13, 2018, 05:11:12 PM  In one end we are working with renowned KYC providers who follow the strictest security policies, and on the other, we have top cryptographers in our team, a security expert working with us as our internal auditor and a third-party auditor looking at our code. So is safe to say we care a lot about security. Regarding the information, we are still defining details with our KYC provider but for now I can comment that we are only going to ask personal information about the user. No weird questions or background information.

"    The KYC at the end makes it seem like a complete cash grab. The reason for doing KYC is to know who the funds raised in the ICO come from.  A respectable project would do KYC before the ICO and not after it, not after close to 8 months of waiting to trade the real coins in...  Now when all those funds have been smoked for several months, this project wants to do KYC... based on legal advice.  This whole ICO has been a disaster when compared to other ICOs at that time.  Very close to be called a scam...",neg
"   so you cannot guarantee that, exactly my point. it is not your problem if the 3rd party gets legal trouble or might be punished by law. and its not your problem if our data gets stolen, i understand that. and i understand that i might sound paranoid, but i cannot stress this enough. unless you have a continuing finanacial relationship with some website then you shouldnt send out your personal information for example, in germany facebook just lost in court that people dont have to use their real names.  i know you try to make me mad by calling me uninformed but you see me throwing around facts and carefull selected questions you cant seem to able awnser.  thats exactly what we need now, people with opinions. thats the only way stuff gets regulated the right way.  but i know using a 3rd party provider saves you so much work and money that there is no way in these times that you could do this yourself. or could you? and maybe save the data securely encrypted inside of your chain. but why bother, its just the legal status of nimiq, lets hand this over to a 3rd party. noone can blame us if we loose the data.

How can you know it is not true?. Again you are using your personal opinion as a fact. Our legal team has strongly adviced us to proceed with KYC. Nimiq is an open source payment protocol and our main goal is for it to be the native payment protocol of the web and we do trust our legal team is aligned with the same vision. If you want to enter into a debate based on your opinions about KYC and wikipedia links you are very welcome to do so, but it just has nothing to do with our project.  because i know there is no court rule to enforce this. otherwise this would be all over the news and unless we dont have any laws and regulations everything we do creates the path into the future. and thats exactly the time when people need to stand up and tell their opinion, tell that they are not ok with how some uninformed people want to run things. i know you dont want to fight that fight and thats why you want to comply a little bit, but not all the way. and there are no facts that proove you are right. and unless you cant proove that you ""have to"" then it simply is not true... the old rule... thats how i know its not based on my opinion. seriously, why do you worry about kyc when ethereum didnt. but yes, the opinion of your (i would like to think (because of what i said) ""uninformed"") legal team is better be save than sorry.  maybe they should think about their jobs and how much they could do once the legal trouble sets in because you didnt let some 3rd party grab all that data. i think yes, they want to go the save and easy route, who wants to fight for privacy right? ^^   Quote from: polylogic on February 18, 2018, 08:35:10 PM Quote from: Nimiq on February 16, 2018, 07:37:16 AM Quote from: polylogic on February 16, 2018, 01:52:42 AM now there are two ways to look at the next step: 1. you BUY BACK OUR ERC-20 Token for your NIM coin at a fixxed rate, actually, your are my customer and i dont want kyc from you.

But we did.... I really feel like you are very much uninformed  First paragraph in 'NET (Token) Creation and Crowdsale Terms'... in bold with a bigger font size than the rest of the document  'IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN, RESIDENT, OR GREEN CARD HOLDER OF THE UNITED STATES OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SALE, YOU CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE CROWDSALE, SO PLEASE DO NOT CONTRIBUTE IN THE CROWDSALE.'  We publicly commented from the beginning: US CITIZENS ARE NOT ALLOWED.  We blocked all IPs coming from the US to our website.  We included a paragraph about personal information:  'We may determine, for regulatory compliance purposes, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations in connection with accepting contributions to create and allocate NET to you or transfer NET to NIM. You agree to provide us such information promptly upon request.'  If you have any other questions please let me know, but I think you are mainly against KYC itself. We are not fans either but again, it is something we are required to do for the sake of the project. Thanks for your support    yes sorry i didnt remember all the terms from your crowdsale a couple of months back, so much has happened... but you had the rule already, thats great, noone from the us invested, awesome.. now... why kyc again? maybe that the right question: why did your legal team advise you to? and yes your right i am against the kyc for some obvious reasons. centralized databases of personal ids with no oversight. oh boy, the history of the internet prooves nothing is safe unless offline. however, its looks like this is the fist time kyc is something i have to think about, sadly you cant give me much reason why kyc is a good idea for your project and why not everybody has to do it. but thanks for trying it was a pleasure",neg
"NIMIQ is a joke.   If they wanted to do KYC they should of done it during the time of the sale, not after it is already selling on an exchange.  Makes no sense.",neg
"i still dont understand why you only collect the data from people that try to swap and not people that are using the network. as i have stated before if you want to become a payment processor you will have to comply with the real regulations, not some made up ones, could you imagen visa without verification? your bank account? why do you target ico users?  but wait, i just noticed.. you send our data to some US KYC firm that works with coinbase and bittrex while not allowing US people to participate? you basicly sell our data to the us authorities and call it the responsible way to do even if we have absolutly nothing to do with the usa. the us data protection and privacy laws are like none existent. did you ever read about snowden (there is a movie now)  every true regulated company that works with money does need the complete kyc from all users (most companys offer a small limit for unverfied users) why does nimiq not ?",neg
"Hey Nimiq guys, you suggested to wait for NIM and NET to be both listed on an exchange in order to avoid the KYC. However there is a big problem: if we do this, we will get almost nothing, since nobody will buy the old token its value will just drop. ",neg
"   With ""the kyc thing"" and the non existing effort of the team for very very simple things like changing the title of the thread for the targeted launch date of the mainnet I'm not very optimistic actually",neg
   only if you trade more than 2BTC per day...  I bought for 200 USD NET and dont understand why should I do KYC to exchange 200 USD on NIM This is stupid and not correct by this scamer coint!!!,neg
"The release of the tech was last year, then postponed to December 2017, then moved to sometimes during Q1. But, after 40+ vlogs and countless drone flights, still no sign of anything. Better to change the Subject of the topic to ""Main net TBC""...  PS: this is not FUD, it is just real facts.",neg
"   Yeah, and I'm a bit disappointed with the delay It all seems to me that the team has more fun around, than doing something useful.",neg
"This coin is nothing short of a scam,  They used all the ICO funds for their jungle parties and when people want to convert the coins to the so called mainnet, they have included a KYC blockade...when any honest business would do KYC before using the funds    Most ICO investors who have held for almost a year now are burnt because of this team's shady self centered policy of spending all users funds on their parties, and asking for KYC at the end when all the coins have been spent  STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM  ",neg
"better to start with mainnet 1 month later, because the market is at this moment not so good",neg
"   So it should be conducted before taking money in the ICO so that people can skip it When the ICO there was no KYC, they have used all the coins and the money raised to party hard and when people are waiting for over  year holding onto their coins, there is a round of ICO... lol its crazy how people justify this  Any transparent product would have raised money BEFORE doing the ico like all coins have been doing for a long time now. Not close to a year after the ICO ...",neg
3 days left for Q1 2018. No pressure ,neg
no need for mainnet during this bear market... better be launch and be listed when poeple start to have fomo,neg
I bought NET at $5. I think it will drop a hell after mainnet if this calculation is correct.,neg
"Nimiq's recent performance has been disappointing, with no strong momentum at the beginning. Has the development reached a bottleneck?",neg
"They added KYC at the last moment, this is causing a lot of ICO investors a lot of worry and problem but the team is least interested in answering or bothering about the ICO ivestors  Why should they? They have got all the money a year ago, spent it all And after a year they have asked ICO investors to complete KYC     Now several ICO investors are left with worthless tokens, I cant even convert it to the mainnet because the KYC accepts only passport as ID, and I have no passport Even Bittrex and Binance complete 3rd tier verification without passport, but apparently not Nimiq  In the end I am left with a bunch of ecr20 tokens that will be useless, after investing and believing in the project for almost a year.    The team is not even responding to this situation   Extremely disappointed",neg
"   I agree with you it's a shame this way, we brought them millions, we supported this project for months and no explanation or support. I'm going to sell and they're going to be f ...",neg
"   I do not vote for nimiq, I sold all that I have, 2000 chips at a loss but I sold, it's a shame how you work and nimiq will soon be worth zero",neg
"WTF Nimiq? I mean really! WTF?  In your FAQ you say this:       How can you justify this statement? According to my ""maths"" that puts 1 NIM at a value of $88 which is BS. You can't call a unit of NIM a satoshshi for fuck sakes. Smarten up!",neg
"   There are so few stores and shops that accepts Bitcoin... and we expect them to accept Nimiq ? Unfortunately, I think that it will really take long for them to begin massively accept cryptocurrencies.  That's a good goal, though.",neg
   It is not me that is confused. It's your website that is misleading. You want this coin to be adopted by the masses then do them a favor and quite with the BS.,neg
  Most of the tokens of the project will drop to varying degrees after ICO and have been dumped by some people.,neg
"The effort I see in the development is important , Webdollar is still developing and , as I said , is getting better every day and they 're also working on marketing . for Nimiq , ok , you did the tech part and it 's great , but ... you ' ve stopped here , which is sad .",neg
"What looks ironic is that someone from Nimiq is making fun of a successful bitcoin fork.even the broken webdollar gets more marketing , adoption and support.nimiq shows no signs of interest to be marketed or adopted , though .",neg
"I know Nimiq is not an Erc20 token , I know that exchanges need to make a rating and I know that you won't get approval from Bina in 2 weeks , but I know that the team should have dealt with this problem before starting Mainnet .",neg
"ts ridiculous , i have a big stack and think nimiq is onto something good, but im sad to say im loosing faith. theres probably 100 million nim that will be dumped when exhange happens because miners have feasted and the demand is not there because there has been no marketing.",neg

You need to add token details to let participants to get in the business!,neg
"   It seems the team has a pretty fancy toy but it is not able to play with peers. They do not invite friends to come along with them and have fun. Translating: the technology is really strong, but it cannot reach the wider community. The marketing should have a different strategy as the one implemented at the moment is simply failing.",neg
"Im in an other project where the dream was to get listed on binance, and it finally came true! the result in this bear market was to have the price drop by 70%. A new (popular) exchange wont make the price magically triple up. There isn't any new money coming in the market at the moment and people already involved either got their money locked in other coins or waiting for btc to do its thing.",neg
nim is dead.,neg
"I suspect the devs dumping and enjoying the life on the beach....  Weird, it was such a good project.  Maybe and hopefully I'm wrong",neg
"  To be honest, I think so.   I suspect the devs dumping So why would they dump Nimiqs instead of Ethers? I fail to understand your logic.",neg
I'm a little disappointed. This isn't for the little guy! Easy web based idea turns into a disaster when all you can do is pool mine and wait and hope you earn something. Great start but I think the non savvy people will walk away and take their power to something they know they can be sure on! Wish I was wrong and hope things change! I will keep watching. Love the map though!!!,neg
I was investing in Brave. it is a really good project. But this one. In my point of view it is a bad one.,neg
"Why was Robin Linus (the CEO) kicked out from nimiq team? Either he exit-scammed nimiq (as there is absolutely no new activity on the github core repository) or was it a dirty inside job to kicked him out from the project (just like Elon Musk)?   Many times, I even ask myself if Robin is still ALIVE? I know that Costa Rica is a very dangerous place, but many bad things could happen to him. Robin in the last videos looked very slim and pale. I don't want even to think about it. I also believe your main investor, Elion Chin who warmly welcomed you in Costa Rica, behave more like the new CEO, but in the same time, it looks like the project is going into a wrong direction with him as the new CEO.",neg
"Nimiq needs a new transparency report about their Funds. Me and some friends of mine from China believe that Nim will become bankrupt next year. Why? They initially raised 10 million dollar during the ICO. Now the ETH raised is worth 5 million. They already spend ~ 5 million for building the main net and they have a burning rate of 300k dollars per month for marketing, travel, development, fake volume on exchanges and servers. So, next year Nimiq will become bankrupt Very probably for this reason, Robin (the CEO of the project) left the project 6 months ago.",neg
   Most of NIM volume is FAKE on exchange. Here is a proof posted by a user on their reddit page  &crop=smart&auto=webp&s=dd52e7e44eff229a13c77010e995c4140bdf500e NIM real volume is less than 5000 usd.,neg
"   See. It is exactly what I am pointing about. You just don't discuss facts and just shout at me making me the boogeyman. While the truth is never brought to light by you. You just ""forgot"" (of course intentionally) to discuss about my 2 true facts.  1. Robin has exited the project. Nobody knows NOTHING about Robin in the last 6 months. Not even one photo, one video, one sound. NOTHING. ZERO proof. He did not use facebook, twitter or anything. I believe he just exit scammed when he saw that the project will become bankrupt. 2. We need a TRANSPARENCY REPORT of how much MONEY you still have. A group of people including me believe that you will become bankrupt next year. Is it TRUE? Your burning rate is 250-300K USD per month, while the project looks almost dead from an outsider view. We need a report, how how much money you still have and how much money you generate and burn every month.",neg
"1. What ROBIN did he create or do in the last 6 months. His last message is about 7 months ago. He did not research anything. He did not deliver anything. This is just a BS story to make us tricked that he never exited the project. He did! Just admit it! There is no input and content from Robin. He is not present in the project. He did not brought anything new to the table. Simple, he doesn't exist in the nimiq project anymore because he exited the project.  Are the rumors right that ROBIN had a physical fight with the other developers from the team and he needed hospitalization?  2. The Transparency reported is ~ 6 months old. Same bullshit. I was asking for a NEW TRANSPARENCY REPORT about your funding and how much Funds you do still have from the ICO. The market has crashed along with your funds from banks and cryptowallets! We believe that the Team Nimiq will became bankrupt next year because of the high burning rate and downfall of the crypto market. Just write a new report with how much money you still have and don't bullshit with content like ""for this ICO we bought a 1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica, while we have 4 dudes in the house and another 2 dudes in Germany"". Thanks",neg
"     It was only ONE conversation on telegram that lasted 2 hours and it was 3 months and 20 days ago! No new information from the CEO of this Project in almost 4 months! What is new about his research? Why he doesn't post anything on facebook, on twitter, on GitHub ( absolutely no commits) NOTHING.    There is a transparency report at -network/transparency-report-74d4d89933fe - as you used the term and numbers from it, I guess you already know about that. I don't think it is necessary for them to publish a report every week, the last one is not even 4 months old. Using the numbers there and considering the changes in BTC and ETH prices as well as their monthly burn rate, I estimate they should at least own about 8 Mio. USD worth of assets - even with a way higher burn rate, that will still be enough for more than a year and they will also get their additional NIM released every 6 months, so nothing to fear about right now.  Totally false. The numbers in the document are at end of July ( ~ 20/08/2017). Now it is almost end of 2018. So there had been over 4 months. I am just asking for a new report about their financial statement due to the fact, we believe the project will become bankrupt next year by 2 reasons. The fall of the crypto market (and their assets as well) and the high burning rate ~ 250-300k usd per month.",neg
"   Such a big BS i have never seen. Probably only in politics i have seen bigger BS than yours. The guy is the ""Creator"" of nimiq, and just told me that the guy was not even important in the project, just a fella who was working from time to time to this side-project. Totally false, he envision the entire project, he built the prototype and most of the code! Without Robin, this project couldn't have been done. He was the main character and this is the reason why I put my money during the ICO.  Where is this research published? Where is it? Oh boy, you will reply to me: it is a top secret document, the secret service keep it secret to avoid leaks to Satoshi Nakamoto who could steal his neat cutting-edge research. Haha. Pathetic.",neg
"You are literally lying. From your telegram comments last day it shows that literally he has exited the project and you DON'T KNOW ANYTHING about Robin, the founder and main guy behind this project. This is due the fact, you are hired to keep the lie to get rolling day after day.  These are your comments about the disappeared of Robin from the project. It shows clearly that you don't know where Robin is and what he is doing. Definitely he is not doing any ""research"" as you are saying.   Why did you post a video that is 11 months old as a proof of Robin participation in the project? It doesn't make any sense. The only sense you make, is that there is no involvement of Robin in this project for 10-11 months.  Why would you lie? Simple. The founder exited the project, the project will become bankrupt next year with all the ICO money, and you Richy are hired to keep the community afloat a few more months.",neg
"   Definitely nobody will continue this project after it burns out all the money worth of 12 million dollars. All the ICO and all coins will go to dust. Most of the people who are active in this project are just the miners with significant hash rate dumping coins on the market. They are active in this project shilling the project to make other people buy  their coins.  Most of us believe that Robin has exited the project after he realized that the project will become bankrupt next year. Pretty much he exit-scam the project with some cash letting the boat crush the iceberg after some time (next year). This is the reason why they don't post anything about Robin the founder of the project (there is no new content including him in the last 6 months). He definitely exit scam the project and not ""doing any top secret research""     I know, I lost a lot of money funding this ICO. I am -90% of my investment, but at least I want to make the truth to be revealed.",neg
"   Get real! Don't dream what you want to dream. The community did not do a god damn thing about the code. The protocol was development using 3 million dollars in funds by them. They did so well that Robin (main guy and developer as well) has left the project. They published in their report that they spend over 250,000 USD every month investing in coding, marketing and communities. The money they invest is the reason why there is some noise in the community. Otherwise nobody gives a cent about this project. Look at the github  Except the team who was well paid with millions and millions of dollars (last year they spent 2-3 million dollars to write code), nobody else contributed in a significant way.",neg
"The project is literally dead, and it will become bankrupt next year. You are saying that the code is being developed and a lot of new commits are coming. Robin is doing a neat secret research that nobody knows about, not even you. These are just lies This is a screenshot from github -network The community is not doing almost anything, and after the nimiq ico will get bankrupt nobody will ever continue the project, and the expensive nimiq seed servers that cost about 10,000 dollars per month, will be closed and the network will shut down for ever.      Look at the screenshot and you can see that all repositories are almost dead from this project. No ""community"" commits",neg
   Still most of the repositories look dead and inactive  from 54 repositories only 6 repositories look maintained last 30 days These are the facts. Don't dream what you want to dream. The community is doing a shit about this project.,neg
"Yea sure. Thanks for comparing Bitcoin. Here is some statistics where anybody can see that nimiq is a dead project. No real developers are interested in this project, although they spend 2 million dollar to develop the software paying developers. Nimiq will die just like NET Nimiq Exchange Token. When they press the kill switch, NIM will go to dust. Just like when they pressed the kill switch on NET    Just be real, developers are not interested in this project. Nobody cares about this project and it doesn't have any impact on the crypto ecosystem.  There is no potential in nimiq. Eventually it will die.",neg
"     I was talking about a kill switch. Like you killed NET, after you become bankrupt you will kill as well the NIM website, seed nodes and the entire network will become offline.    And about developers interested in the project, you just have to join the community to see how engaged and interested community developers are. You actually seem to be pretty interested in the project too    Oh boy. After investing in the ICO and having my investment -90%, I AM NOT INTERESTED INTO THIS SHITCOIN. I took my loses and I moved on.",neg
"another fail of nimiq ""great tech"". The nimiq was and mined by some time with GPU while there is support only for CPU. Here is some benchmark from some users.  1x RTX 2080 = 370KH/s 1x GTX 1080 = 222KH/s 1x GTX 1080TI = 332 kH/s 1x R9 290 = 200kH/s 1x GTX 1070 TI = 184KH/s  RTX 2080 Ti  ~510 kH/s Titan XP - 400 kH/s Titan V - 540 kH/s Tesla P100  - 470 kHs Tesla V100 - 740 kH/s GTX 1060 3Gb - ~140kH/s GTX 1060 6Gb - ~160  here is proof of the GPU miners who are mining this CPU only coin. Total fail    it'd only take around 400-500 webminers to compete with a single GPU      He is talking about ledger not the Nano blockchain",neg
"Why Nimiq will 100% fail? The truth that is never told.  1. The team raised 12 million dollars during the ICO. That investment is -90% for all ICO investors. 2. They raised 12 million dollars, while the project market cap is only 2 million dollars, but instead they bought a 1.2 million dollar villa in Costa Rica. I didn't know that a villa in Costa Rica is more expensive than a villa in Las Vegas. 3. In one year for launching the project, they spent nearly 5 million dollars without doing any marketing. Pretty much they wash ICO money, steady, but surely. Doing marketing will burn all the money. 4. They spent so much money on developers, while the developers best app is Nimipet a fucking joker game with 100 users daily. 5. At the moment, the burning rate according to their previous report before starting the marketing is 250,000 dollars per month. 6. A mining pool was closed due to financial troubles aka Philpool. Another mining pool is set to be closed tonight. 7. Robin (main guy) and founder of the project left the project about 7 months ago. 8. They keep lying that Robin is doing a secret top notch research, while he left the project. 9. The community is full of bots to make us believe that the community telegram is growing. 10. They use a trading bot to create fake volumes and set the market cap at fixed 2 million dollar. 11. Nimiq REAL VOLUME is less than ~ 10,000 dollars, the rest of it is FAKE VOLUME generated by trading bots. 12. They paid shillers like Shay, the guy from Twitter to shill the shit out of nimiq. 13. Except 30 people, the rest of the community left the project definitely with huge loses. 14. CPU mining only, while people started mining using GPU rigs for months!!! 15. With their current stats they will become bankrupt. It will be exactly an ""internet bubble"" company and all nims will go to dust! They just need to press the killswitch",neg
NIMIQ is mined with GPU rigs and SkyPool (one pool) dominates 73% of the network. Philpool was closed last night     the hashrate distribution looks more and more like a coin that will die in 2019,neg
"1. ICO price was 1 ETH for 175 NET. ICO price was $1.30USD per 100NIM, it means ICO price for 1 NIM = 0,013 USD. Now the price of NIM is 0.000806. Do the math yourself. It is 16x times smaller than the ICO price. If you had invested 100, now your investment is worth 16 dollars. What a great deal!  2. They bought a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica. Read the fucking transparency report. It shows clearly that now they have a 1.1 million dollar villa describe as an asset. I don't think they bought the villa before the ICO.    3. They spent over 5 million dollar in the first year. Probably in 2019 they will spend another 5 million dollars for the software development (RUST, design, etc...) and market study. By the end of the next year, the project will simply be bankrupt and close exactly like Beepool without any warning.  4. Their burning rate per month is higher than 250,000 usd because now it includes extra costs of traveling, more people in the team (they hired a bunch of newbies), marketing boat, etc. Probably for the moment, the burning rate per month is about $350,000.  5. Beepool and Philpool both closed this week due to lack of keeping the joke alive for too much. The project just became worthless and it is just keeping alive. Like internet bubble, there will be a day when we will read a medium post: ""Unfortunately, due to the high cost of the project, we need to shutdown the nimiq network. But still the source will be available on GitHub""  6. Robin lost a lot of weight ( ~ 50kg ) and you can see this by comparing the last videos from April with the really videos. Also there is a huge change in the mindset of Robin and the way he is looking in the camera. Most of the people from the nimiq community believes that Robin lost weight due to the fact that Robin used to consume coke and eventually he became an crack addict. In Central America coke is definitely way cheaper than in other places. This is the simple reason why at the moment Robin (the main guy) is not present in  the videos and he lost a lot of weight  7. Somebody proved that the volume of NIM is totally fake. They either run a trading bot by themselves losing money or they paid an exchange to report fake volume to Coin Market Cap  Here is the finding of a user who posted the proof of the volume bot on reddit     8. Why they pay shillers at all? The team said in many times that they will never use the shitcoin shillers to shill  9. The active community is less than 30 people. Do you want me to count the active users in the last 30 days? Everybody else left the project for good. Including Robin the main guy  10. The killswitch are the seed nodes. If there wasn't any killswitch why in the world they have seed nodes and they keep them online. Moreover, a few months ago when they used to have problems with the seed nodes many of the users complied on discord that they couldn't use the safe wallet. By the way, the seed nodes cost more than $20,000 per month for the team to maintain it. Why it costs so much? Simply, the project is not salable and it will never be salable. Nimiq just transformed itself into an internet bubble that will pop this year, 2019",neg
"   Yeah sure.. I can tell you only that your 100 bucks now is now worth 16 bucks.  I can bet on one grand that this project will get bankrupt before end of this year. Nimiq can never get widely used because it has scalability issues (worst than Bitcoin) (block size is 4 times smaller, processing functions are not native compiled in ASM ) so it will also allow less tx/s in production. Node and Rust as well is way slower than C. There is no utility, just a bunch of people who dream of lambos and moons",neg
"   Exactly my friend! We want some real clarifications from the team, and just the old BS telling us how great they are. They always try avoid to tell us proofs about their statements. This is exactly how every ICO is talking forgetting any real answers to the questions i have asked about:  1) Current Burning rate  per month is higher than 300,000 dollars? 2) How much cash do they still have from the 12 million dollar ico? YES OR NO. 3) Did they bought a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica 4) What happens when the ""ico internet bubble"" will bust, will the network be down due to the lack of scalability and expensive network infrasture. 5) Did Robin the founder of the project exit the project due to drugs addiction or he exit scammed the project. I want an answer from him. I didn't see him for over 6 months in this project. 6) They premined 2.5% to charity. Did they send the money to charity. Which charity. Please LIST and YES OR NO. 7) They premined 2.5% to FoundationX. Did you send it to the foundation? YES OR NO.  Who administrate the charity and foundation funds. The team nimiq or WHO?",neg
"I am really pissed off on nimiq now. I am 100% sure that nimiq is an ICO scam and they will scam-exit the project. Beside the fact that they hide everything like people, names, shares, foundation members, charity organization they premined 5%, how much money they gave themselves with who they work... etc. Signals for a scam. But today we have a BIG SIGNAL FOR SCAM. After Robin Linus (the founder of the project) left the project, today another nimiq contributior left the nimiq foundation....   “Arthur Gervais, an early contributor and friend to Nimiq, will be leaving the foundation’s board to fully focus on his role as the CEO of @liquiditynet and his academic work (together with #Nimiq). “  from nimiq news",neg
"    1. How much cash do they still have ? Did they buy a 1.1 million dollar in Costa Rica YES OR NO. 2. The team PREMINED 7.5% of the entire work. PREMINED = funds that were not POW mined. They PREMINED it with a simple line of code. That is what premine means. I have never heard of ImpactX Foundation. Is there a link to their website? If not why does the team avoid to tell us the foundation details like registration number, city, address, etc... The first vesting of premined funds for charity and InpactX were already received. Why did they not send the funds to ImpactX and Charity ?? DO they keep for themselves  Regarding my argument that ROBIN LINUS has left the project either to drug abuse or to exit scam. Robin last activity was slightly before launching the project. After launching the main net he never posted anything..... he just disappeared from Planet Earth . Here is a proof, his medium activity    @RobinLinus  His account did not have any kind of activity from  April 11. About 7 months ago. Did Robin Linus exit scammed the project or did he get into a drug abuse center",neg
"I was a big fan of Nimiq but I'm getting very disappointed.  1) In Telegram I respectfully asked to clarify these questions but they blocked me. Why do you try to suppress the discussion? 2) Why is @normana answering all questions here? Looks like he has inside information. Is he a team member trying to hide his identity behind a pseudonym? 3) ""Did Robin Linus exit scammed the project or did he get into a drug abuse center?"" Why does Robin Linus not end this FUD with a simple video?  Please unblock me in Telegram! ( @coinfanatic )",neg
"   2) Maybe because he's the only one who have enough courage and motivation to fight againt this kind of obstinate people spreading FUD all day long. He didn't give any information and didn't say he had some informations. Maybe he's just believing in the project, like me and a bunch of others.  3) I agree with you, it needs to be clarified.  1) I don't see your posts in the Telegram channel, I think the ban deleted them. Could you show them here?",neg
   The sad part is that they call themselves the most Censorship Resistant Coin on the market. What Censorship Resistant while they ban the hell out of everybody who is joining and put just a few questions for clarifications. They also delete all unwanted users and messages from discord as well. Definitely it would remove for some this doubt that Robin exit scammed the project or that he got into a drug abuse center. A video of him explaining his 8 months hard working research and even source code would remove doubts of us. But you know? He will never show a video again for a few years. He disappeared just like Satoshi Nakamoto.... but here with 12.9 million dollar from the ico. SCAM  They pay the community members to shill out the project and administrate this scam to make it go a few more months on.  Quote Did they buy a 1.1 million dollar in Costa Rica YES OR NO.  Oh my fucking good. Did they post that they bought a 1.1 million usd estate with the ICO money ??  I am an ICO investor and I need clarifications!!!,neg
"   1) This honestly makes no sense at all. Why would they still pay and hire new externals if they plan to do a scam, that would just be reducing their own earnings. Also please consider that at this point they actually provided the product they proposed in their whitepaper and ICO terms, which for sure costed them a lot of work.

"   Does IMPACT X FOUNDATION EXISTS ? WHO OWNS THE MONEY? RICHY, ROBIN.... WHO OWNS THE MONEY THE IMPACTX Foundation?  why did they not give the money to charity as they promised in the ICO???   1) This honestly makes no sense at all. Why would they still pay and hire new externals if they plan to do a scam, that would just be reducing their own earnings. Also please consider that at this point they actually provided the product they proposed in their whitepaper and ICO terms, which for sure costed them a lot of work. They would definitely the most ineffective and most stupid scam ever - or depending on the definition, not a scam at all if they provided what they proposed to provide...  They are paying people to shill the project to make other people to buy their worthless coins. The action they do was revealed to me. They want for time to passed in order to tell us: ""Guys we spent 12 million dollar and we delivered a blockchain project. This is it. Unfortunately we no longer have ICO money to do anything else"".  Probably richy will post a medium post in mid of this year telling us that they will no longer have funds for the project to continue and team developers in btaches will leave the project. Just like Robin the founder of the project who left the project 8 months ago.   2) Sorry, but this makes you sound like the most stupid ICO investor ever.

They scammed us... and we were too stupid to believe them. They don't want to answer to these questions and they will never answer to these questions.

   Robin Linus admitted that Nimiq investors got scammed: ,neg
"I knew it. I was right! Nimiq is a dead project and finally the project founder confirmed that NIM will die. It is just a matter of time when this will gonna happen. Richy and the other team members took over the ICO money and over the project from Robin. They just burn its money to make it bankrupt and to keep they remaining funds for themselves. Robin just posted on telegram after 8 months that they still have an ""internal fight"" with other team mebers over the project money and direction. Pretty much the team is clueless about where it should go. Moreover, Richy and he is fellows shillers were always lying that Robin was busy doing research, while the founder of the project was just kicked out from the project Every time I asked something, Richy and other content moderators (paid shillers) they were always lying about the project current funds and that Robin was his doing ""secret research"". We JUST WANT THE TRUTH otherwise the project will gonna die and the ICO investors most probably will ask for a REFUND. Because they founded a legal foundation, the ICO investors can ask in court for a refund of their eth do to the fact that the project was failing and that always richy and other fellows were lying to us.   Robin:      They should better answer to the following questions in their report until Sunday  1. How much money do they still have? 2. Did they buy a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica? 3. Burning Rate per month ? 4. What is the cost of the infrastructure per month to keep the network alive? 5. When they estimate a bankruptcy? 6. Do they have trading bot for fake volumes? 7. Was Robin Linus kicked out from the project due to the fact that Richy and other members took over the project from him? 8. Is the ImpactX Foundation registered at all? Does it Exist? 9. Who manages ImpactX Foundation premined funds? Richy or who? 10. Why did they not give the ImpactX Foundat premined funds to the charity as they described in the medium white paper. 11. Who manages Nimiq Foundation premined funds ? Richy or who? 12. Why they lie to us ? Like ""oh robin is doing this top-neat research stuff that we will show it to you soon"" 13. Did really Robin really had done something on ""his research"" in the last 6 months. What are the results and when we can see them. 14. Was the project took over by Richy and his click 15. What happen when they get bankrupt. Will the network shut down after they go bankrupt ??  They just need to click the kill switch and the network will be shut down. Just like when they killed the Nimiq Exchange Token.",neg
"    after reading this statement from Robin (he is alive btw), now i convinced 100% that nimiq team was deceiving us always through their telegram/discord communities and of course through their videos about the status of their project. Knowing parts of the truth, it looks more like Bitconnect with their well made videos and conferences. Nimiq just became a bitconnect at a smaller scale. You join their communities on telegram or discord and you get an instant ban in 3 minutes. The project will more likely get closed by the end of this year when the ico funds will get evaporated by who knows who... Maybe they will do another ICO #2 ""First Rust Blockchain in the World""   later edit: @norma who the fuck are you? Stop talking about facts according to your ""assumption"" Your assumptions are not numbers and facts. You just look like Matthew Ludwig the ""community"" guy who is 24/24 online (yes he doesn't sleep) and he is paid to shill the project on their telegram and reddit (la_r_ma)  PROOF @NORMA IS FUCKING LYING. NIMIQ DOESN'T SUPPORT MULTI SIGNATURES. STUPID FUCKING LIAR NIMIQ DOESN'T SUPPORT MULTI FUCKING SIGNATURE WALLET. END OF STORY. FUCK YOU STUPID PRICK WHO IS CLEANING THEIR SCAM SHIT  IMPACTX charity foundation doesn't exist. It is not registered and it simply doesn't exist. There is NO multi signature wallet.  here is a quote in case @norma will delete his message with his ""facts"" and ""numbers""... i didn't know @norma is God who is omniscient and knows all facts and numbers.  Quote from: normana on January 05, 2019, 01:34:39 PM I am going to answer the questions to the best of my knowledge and with pure logic and trust that we'd have heard about any groundbreaking changes: 8. Is the ImpactX Foundation registered at all? Does it Exist? Yes 9. Who manages ImpactX Foundation premined funds? Richy or who? MultiSignature wallet with keys hold by foundation board members 10. Why did they not give the ImpactX Foundat premined funds to the charity as they described in the medium white paper. ImpactX Foundation is a charity, so they gave funds to a charity as described 11. Who manages Nimiq Foundation premined funds ? Richy or who? MultiSignature wallet with keys hold by foundation board members",neg

"    the project is just a simple ICO scam. They wasted 10% of the ICO money in order to buy an expensive 1.1 million villa in Costa Rica in order to make video of them surfing and eating sushi. Worst investment, even the founder who exited the project admitted the project is a total failure for the investors who lost -95%  of the original investment. The project will be deadd in just a couple of months when the ICO money will get evaporated. Probably you have read about a different project. Nimiq ICO was a total FAILURE. There is no bounty campaign and there will never be. Just stay out from the project, it is worthless and you will lose money as I did investing into this shitcoin",neg
"this project is worthless and worst investment possible for me. I am at -95% ICO value. The team is just wasting the ICO money buying houses and expensive stuff and from time to time they do some videos. There is no bounty program. This is just a shitcoin that looks ""nice"". Worst project ever. They always lie and now they have an internal fight. The project will die this year.  Scalability is worst than in Bitcoin. It can handle at least 5 times less transactions than btc. No smart contracts GPU miners at the moment are running the network although the team didn't publish an official gpu miner Burning rate of $ 350-400 K per month They lie like: ""Robin is doing this neat research, but after 8 months we heard that Robin was kicked out from project due to internal struggles over the money and project lead"" Very expensive infrastructure, no scalability Rust implementation is dead and not working Project will be dead.

"i hope the ICO will get a refund.... otherwise all our investment will worth not much than 0. Also the team need to take in consideration that the burning rate is very high and the project will run out of money in a year or so. Last year they spent 5 million dollar with their project. Probably this year they will spend at least 7-8 million dollar due to the new development activities, new employees, expensive travels, servers, the mansion in Costa Rica, etc... Did they also buy a house in Germany as well? The team did not receive any kind of real traction and indeed as other bitcointalk members discussed already, it look like the team is simply washing the ICO money to exit by paying themselves very expensive bonuses and wages...  i hope i will get a refund soon...",neg

The worst thing is that not only ICO investors will lose money, but also NIM holders (miners, investors, people who bought it online), exchanges, etc. NET (Nimiq Exchange Token) was already killed by pressing a button, this year another thing will get closed namely NIM network and all transactions will be suspended.",neg
"this project is so fucked up. They have internal disputes within the internal project (probably over the money), they ban everybody on discord and telegram. They new members are just paid bots to look that their community is growing.  The project is so censored that they introduced a special bot on their Reddit page that bans every newbie on the reddit page. They lost most of the ICO money and they shout to everybody on their telegram channel that everybody is a fudder. The project didn't receive any traction and it is so fucked up. The project is starting to look more like a bitconnect scam. Maybe nimiq was designed to be a bitconnect clone... but with a better story. I am really disappointed in the project and I also hope they will start a process of refunding.",neg

"I can not believe it!!! Everything that was posted on bitcointalk was absolutely right! I can not believe what my eyes see!!! My mind is just blowing at the moment. Every single sentence written by these people on bitcointalk was totally right. These people Ricardo Barquero (Richy), Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Elion Chin, Marvin Wissfeld, Pascal Berrang, Atua Mo’e, Tammo Mamedi, Chris Mo’e, Curd Becker, Sören Schwert, Daniel Mohr, Sui-Ju Chuang (穗如), Sven Buschbeck, Julian Bauer, Jeffrey Esquivel, Sebastian Dietel, Robin Linus, Maximilian Harz, Mauricio Lara, Philipp Tschabold, Arthur Gervais, Amy Zhang  and others are stealing ICO investors money. I will explain how they steal ICO money above.  Robin the Founder of the project who got kicked out from the project, today he posted concerns that confirms all the above statements from the other bitcointalk members that the Nimiq Team is liying and they are stealing money from the ICO investors.  Robin confirmed the following on a post on Reddit  :  1. The team (especially Richy and other community paid shillers) was lying for over 8 months that Robin was doing a secret cutting-edge research while he lost weight due to drugs abuse. 2. The team always lying that Robin had a drug abuse addiction. 3. They WASH ICO MONEY explaining it in transparency report. Remember the 1.1 million dollar mansion in Costa Rica? Half a million dollar in travels? Right these are washed money that goes directly to their pocket. Probably Elion is the master of this washing process. 4. They use FAKE TRADING BOT for FAKE VOLUME. The Volume is 100% FAKE and they never recognized, but isntead lied that the trading volue is 100% legit. 5. The project will become bankrupt by end of this year. It means that the Nimiq Network will get permanetly shutdown due to high expensive costs and nobody in the project is interested in the project without receiving high bonuses from the team in terms of hundrends of thousands of dollars. 6. The project is dead. 7. The ICO was not done legally according to the US laws in Jully. User yuluxugi32132 explained it correctly in his report on Bitcointalk and I am planning to do Court Actions to retrieve my ETH back from the ICO. It is a total SCAM ICO and the team should be legally responsable by administrating this ICO.  How they steal the money? Simply... they keep the project alive for several months in order to get generous salaries, bonuses and to wash ICO money through expensive travel, food expensive and artificial monthly burning rate. This is the reason why they invested 1.1 million dollars to buy a mansion in Costa Rica, but they never explained this. They always refused to explain to the community members about the ImpactX foundation 2.5% premine (if the foundation exists, who owns it, who administrates it, who received money). This is the reason for a couple of members they spent almost half a million dollar for two international fights between Germany to Costa Rica last year. They are washing legit ICO money to their pocket  A PERSON HAD TO COMMIT SUICIDE IN ORDER FOR THE PROJECT TO REVEAL PARTS OF THE TRUTH. HOW MUCH STUFF WE WILL DISCOVER WE WILL FIND OUT SOON.       Man, I hope you went to heave if you commit the horrendous act to suicide. You shouldn't have done this horrible act by losing money investing into these mother fuckers. I am praying for you that our Lord will forgive you for doing this, and instead to punish the responsible ones.",neg
guys did you see Robin's post??? yuluxugi32132 was right that Robin was addicted to drugs and about everything else? How did you know? Did you have inside information? It shows clearly that the Team Nimiq is exit scamming the ICO money... I am utterly disappointed and the project will become dead in a couple of months. Sooner than you think and the network will get closed by the end of the year. Stay away they use trading bots to deceive people about being successful while nobody is using nimiq and will never use it. The network will shutdown before summer.   ,neg

My only concern is that, while these people on bitcointalk and dozens of telegram and discord members got removed, banned from chat groups for telling the truth behind this scam, why didn't you say anything publicly.

We need to stop him immediately otherwise in a couple of months our money and this scam project will be bye-bye and he will be driving a fucking Lamborghini in Germany.

Anyway we need to see what bullshit they can come up with in a few hours and also the AMA on Reddit at the end of week before coming to further conclusions...",neg
"   I also hope to find ways to refund my huge investment in the ICO. I believe this can happen with a 50% chance. Yuluxugi posted a list  where he pointed out that the Initial Token Offer was done by individuals or by a company. The foundation in Switzerland and the KYC was done after the ITO was completed done. So by this, they have done a illegality in the United States according to the laws in the States. They had do done KYC before selling the ITO, not after selling the ITO. Regarding the chance, i mentioned 50% done. There are some costs involved in the process to sue them. I know there had been done some success by SEC and convicted people. Here are some examples of successful ICO refunds:   Paragon ( -demands-ico-refunds-what-will-this-mean-for-crypto-.html ) -orders-cryptocurrency-companies-return-money-ico-investors-ground-breaking-settlement/  Quote A pair of cryptocurrency companies have been ordered to offer money back to investors who participated in their initial coin offerings, which should have been registered with federal regulators, marking the latest move in the government’s bid to regulate the often unpredictable and trendy financial market.  The two companies — Paragon Coin and CarrierEQ — came to settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and will each have to pay fines of $250,000. In addition to returning funds to investors, the two companies will have to file financial statements and other documents that give prospective investors a window into the health of the business, a first for an ICO case.  “We have made it clear that companies that issue securities through ICOs are required to comply with existing statutes and rules governing the registration of securities,” Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division said in a statement. “These cases tell those who are considering taking similar actions that we continue to be on the lookout for violations of the federal securities laws with respect to digital assets.”  Paragon, which raised $12 million in a August 2017 ICO, uses blockchain, the de-centralized record keeping technology that is mostly tied to cryptocurrencies, to manage supply chain tracking for the marijuana industry. CarrierEQ, which is also known as Airfox and provides financial services in emerging markets, raised $15 million in an October 2017 ICO.  The SEC orders don’t accuse the firms of fraud, and the companies didn’t admit to or deny the findings in the settlement. The SEC found that the companies’ tokens, the virtual currency used to support the ICOs, should have been registered as securities, or investments that will make returns for investors should the companies be successful.  Blockvest LLC ( @listoficomarketing/ico-sued-by-sec-for-false-claims-a5774d914f4b )  Centra ICO and Floyd Mayweather  ( -mayweather-and-dj-khaled-sued-for-involvement-in-centra-ico-scam/ )  So everything is possible. We can also do some steps before suing them to report their SCAM ICO to different journalists and ICO scam websites including       We need to report nimiq as a ICO scam to these websites.",neg
   What is the latest word you have on this that gives you such confidence?  This looks pretty dead at the moment.,neg
"   I am not the author of Jaxx wallet, but I only use the Jaxx wallet. I love it so much. It is soo cool and all my real coins (except scams like nimiq) are held there safely. NiPoPoW was not first integrated into nimiq. There were two other currencies that had nipopow before them. One of them is a Russian coin (i don't rembmer the name) but they implemented NiPoPoW back by the end of the 2016. Also WebDollar a coin without ICO implemented NiPoPoW. So it is not rocket science.  Probably the bitcointalk will increase in number and the can sue the shit out of them.",neg
"    nimiq is dead and probably their network will shut down this year as well. All dead coins shutdown their networks, especially this coin because the network is very centralized and its infrastructure is very expensive. It costs them about $50,000  per month to keep the seed nodes alive. When they shut down the network, nobody else can use the tokens anymore",neg
"   We don't need no proofs just the courage not to deny the reality unfolding  I said that Robin had left the project in the Discord in July and people said it wasn't the truth, just fudding, no proof etc. and look how the truth is today.  The same with our prediction for Nimiq. If things carry on as they are, this coin will be finished by the end of the year.",neg
"   Scamiq you need to understand that some of them have a serious illness of pathological lying. Some of them started to believe their own lies and the lies feeded by Richy and Elion. They can not believe that there are a lot of angry ICO investors who got scammed. F2b how do you think they raised 12 fucking million dollars? Simply, because stupid people like us handed them money to create something they promised but never done. They just launched a shitcoin. Their real scope was to scam exit the project. It is possible that everything Robin has done was the beginning of his final act of scam exit the project and move on another ICO... like nimiq2",neg
  At least you know it   ...and move on another ICO... like nimiq2 ICOs are dead right now.,neg
   yeah exactly like nimiq scam.  This shitcoin is dead and we just want a refund at the ICO Price. Nothing more. Waisted time and resources into this scam.,neg
folks any update with the refunding I would like to know if you get any updates regarding the ICO funding.  Meanwhile this a proof of how they ban people for a posting a simple meme. Yeah... sure this nimiq censorship free project. It is more censored than in North Korea. At least they don't fire a tomahawk to these users.  ,neg
"SCAM ALERT !!!! SCAM ALERT !!!!  SCAM ALERT !!!!    They just kicked the Founder of the project! They kicked Robin Linus due to the fact he was telling us the truth about the project. The project was taken over by Phillip, Elion, Richy, and Pascal. They took over all the ICO money in order to steal it. They kicked Robin and already they banned him from telegram. They are scammers and stole 12 million dollars. I want my money back from the ICO. They are stealing my fucking money and my husband money., Please I need to report this to the police that they stole our money through a company during the ITO sale. I am an American citizen and during their ITO they didn't have KYC and sold to me tokens!! I WANT A REFUND OF MY ICO! THEY LIED FOR OVER 8 MONTHS ABOUT ROBIN AND EVERYTHING ELSE! THEY JUST WANT TO JUSTIFY THE STEALING OF THE ENTIRE ICO MONEY AND THEN TO SHUT DOWN THE PROJECT! AFTER THIS THEY WILL PUBLISH A MEDIUM ARTICLE THAT WILL SAY: ""look, we are sorry, we became bankrupt!"". I WANT MY MONEY BACK! THEY ARE SCAMMERS WHO SCAMMED ME DECEIVING US.",neg
"The project was hijacked and transformed into a catastrophic scam. I want my money back too. We kicked from the team Robin, the only person who challenged them about buying a 1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica, having a fake trading bot, high burning rate and going to bankruptcy stealing ICO money  ",neg
Robin recognized that NIMIQ ( NET ICO ) WAS A SCAM  see here ,neg
oh my GOD!!! ROBIN (THE FOUNDER OF THE PROJECT) AKWKEDGED THAT THE PROJECT IS A SCAM    READ READ READ!!!! THEY SCAM US!!,neg
"They are really liars. Their only intention is to steal our money for good. While they posted that they kicked robin from the project due to the dispute over the money, Robin just confirmed on telegram he will receive 1/3 of the funds for a separate and new blockchain. Probably not even a fork.  They somehow forgot to explain that 1/3 of the funds will be moved to Robin in their statement. GUYS WAKE UP! THEY ARE SCAMMERS!    They run fake accounts on telegram, discord and bitcointalk  The founder of project recognized this!  Their marketing is to pay shillers and fake accounts  SCAM SHIT COIN ! SCAM ICO",neg
"I don't get it, are they still gonna pay Robin the pothead a third of the money so he can get addicted again",neg
"   yup. So probably this is the real scenario. The scamers ( the rest of the team nimiq ) got threatened by the Robin ( he is still the head of the foundation and nobody can fire him) that he will unveil the stuff they do in Costa Rica. Did you know that they registered over 5 organisations some companies and other non-profit organizations? So in order to make Robin stop uncovering the truth, they decided to give 1/3 of the funds to the crackhead, Robin Linus. Probably they have like 5 million dollars in funding at maximum. With 1/3 of the funds moved to crackhead Robin, team nimiq will have only 3 millions, so the bankruptcy now will be 100% guaranteed before the end of September when they will shut down the network. At least we will see Philipp in jail and arrested by Christmas. This is the real story about their finances and while they always just forget to explain their real finances.",neg
"   as far as I understood, the pothead will get 1/3 of the funds to build a new blockchain from scratch that is UTXO. So it won't be a hardfork but rather a new blockchain from scratch. Maybe he will do another ICO     new memes         and my favorite one ",neg
"If thats all true then oh god  For the love of god I hope its not true - except the part about Philipp going to jail, that would be a good first step.",neg
"   I forgot that I am quite confident that Robin will not build anything. He just wants the money to exit scam. I have never seen a worst public-scam like this in my life. I have seen many scams, but this one is the worst nice scam in the world.",neg
"The only thing I don't understand. Why they lie the community always. Always I feel like: they say 30% and lie 70%. For instance today's communication, they just forgot to tell us that: ""hey dudes, we commited 1/3 of the funds to Robin they guy who he kicked him from the project, but still he is the head of the Foundation""",neg
"   According to Robin, he did not break the agreement that would give him 1/3rd of the funds. The team says otherwise. Probably they had something in the agreement to prevent Robin from hurting the project in the public as they foresee the possibility of him doing so. And now they argue this happened so the agreement was terminated (that's why they now say that Robin is no longer a member of the team). Robin probably argues that he did not hurt the project, he just woke everyone up, so he is under the assumption that the agreement is still in place.  But that doesn't say anyone of them lied, it could just be different opinions on how to read a contract. In the end it might be that a court has to decide.",neg
"PROOF THAT THEY USE TRADING BOT. THE MARKET CAP IS EXACTLY AT 2 MILLION DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE SOLD TOLDAY, THE MARKET CAP WENT AGAIN TO 2 MILLION DOLLARS. THEY SET UP THIS TRADING BOT TO KEEP THE PRICE UP, BUYING ALL BIDS THAT UNDER 19 SATOSHI. THE TRADING BOT IS BURNING A LOT OF MONEY. THIS IS THE REASON WHY PPL SAID IT IS A STABLE COIN. SCAM COIN    Red Line is exactly 2 million dollars market cap. They use the bot to buy all small bids. They manipulate the market exactly as Robin accused them, and they never replied. The volume is totally artificially made. Most probably the pump was made by them as well in order to experiment if stupid people will buy this shitcoin.",neg
"    Norman Alsbander stupid fucker and liar. You are paid by your friends to fucking shit and lie about their FAILURE PROJECT AND SCAM. STUPID MUTHER FICKER.    Price is stable at 19 satoshi and market cap at 2 million by a trading bot. If not even Robin the founder of the project doesn't know what happens inside, then who the fuck knows better. Probably our praised God norma the mother fucker from Germany.",neg
SCAM ALERT! yulugi was totally right. They invested 10% of the ICO money into fucking buying a villa from the Elion Chin. This is the proof that they bought the Villa.    Where the fuck is the Nimiq Campus? I didn't see it. Also I don't think that 2 store villa in Costa Rica is worth 1.1 million dollars. They washed ICO money to give it to Elion Chin!,neg
proof that Robin will take 1/3 THIRD OF THE ENTIRE ICO MONEY ,neg
"The scammers behind Nimiq are either the Biggest Scammers in the world or they become Pathologic liars. Look at the message Richy is propagating deceiving people    What transparency? Seriously!! What transparency !! There is absolutely no transparency. Here is a list of how liars and shady are these scammers from nimiq  1. We found out after 8 months that Robin Linus founder of the project became a severe drug addict. 2. They never talked about any fight between Robin Linus and the rest of the team. After 8 months, Robin became from the dark and just uncovered how shady team nimiq is and he has an internal fight with the rest of the team for over a year. 3. They lied to us for 6 months that Robin was still in the project doing research, while he didn't do anything and he was back home in Germany getting medical attention to solve his ""severe drug addiction"" to cannabis 4. They never explained that they spent 1.1 million dollars of their ICO (10%) in order to buy a mansion. 5. They are accused by the founder of the project to be running a fake volume trading bot. 6. They didn't communicate anything about their salaries only the fact that they spent 5 million dollars in a year of running the operations.  In over 2 years, they only made a report without proofs (there is no proof in that document that they owned that amount of btc and eth as in the report). They should have shown us the ETH and BTC addresses. 7. Robin accused them of paying shillers and having members with fake accounts to promote the project. They always refused this. 8. They showed us a document that they removed Robin from the project, but this is impossible (another lie) because Robin Linus is the president of the foundation and they simply can't fire Robin from that position. 9. After the document, they just forgot to mention that they commited 1/3 (YES, ONE THIRD) of the ENTIRE ICO MONEY to Robin Linus after they kicked him out from the project. 10. Robin accused them to have really generous salaries and asked them to reduce their salaries down to $80k/month, taking in consideration that the members get paid in nims but also from the ICO money 11. They are not interested in the ICO money, and nobody except Robin cared about the ICO investors who lost over 98% of their investment, while the team decided to buy a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica.",neg
"suddenly nimiq scam got a 15x volume increase from 40k from 560k in just 30 minutes, but there is no difference in price both usd and btc. Totally fake volume. Uncontestable proof.  here is the proof   take a lot",neg
"   No. They always lie about everything. For investors, they need to be transparent, while their transparency is a fundamental lie in a way or another. They kept secret their fight with Robin liying investors that he is doing research. It is clear that Robin will receive 1/3 of the funds. I can guarantee you that if Robin would have been kicked out from the project with 0 money in his pocket, now he would sue the crap out of them.  They always lie and they don't care about the project, they are just interested to wash the money and put it in their own pocket. Where is the Nerd Temple? Why did they have to buy a 1.1 million dollar mansion is Costa Rica? Why they lie that Robin was working on research while he was severely addicted to drugs. Why did he exit the project? Simply he will receive 1/3 of the funds and he will manage it directly! They just forgot to explain that they approved 1/3 of the funds to be sent to Robin. The thing he explained is that the money is approved by a committee that he has all the guarantees will respect him and him alone.  Here is a conversation between a whistleblower and Robin where Robin explains that 1/3 of the funds are guaranteed sent it to him    They always lie. Nothing honest is behind this scam. I lost all my money.",neg
"the project is dead. they have lost a lot of money since they made the mistake of leaving much of it in cryptocurrency and the market is down. They don't have money even to clean their shit. I can confirm the rumors that Robin will receive 1/3 of the funds to a separate project from nimiq. They just want to take the ICO money home, they won't do anything significant in the following months. I am out, I am selling everything. I just hope for a refund of the ICO investment.  They ban everybody. The censorship it is a its high on their channels. Worst possible project and investment. I am -98% of my investment. I can just take a couple thousands dollars back from my investment. Worst project ever",neg
scam nimiq is not interested into marketing. No exchanges are interested into them as one of the founder exited the project taking 1/3 of the project funds    excellent news for stupid ico investors,neg
"SCAM ALERT    They want to convert NIM to Proof of Stake. They premined 7.5% of the coin for themselves. 7.5% of all coins. It means they own over 60% of the current mined coins. You will tell about vesting, guess that in october was the first vesting, and in few months (exactly like in his plan) will unlock the 2nd vesting. The project is a SCAM!",neg
"    How could we no talk about Robin. He STOLE 1/3 OF THE PROJECT FUNDING. Let's suppose they still have 9 million dollars, Robin just too from them about 3 million dollars ... yesterday. For the moon boys out here, nobody is interested into this shitcoin. Richy recognized this and exchanges don't even consider the project for listing. Total failure and SCAM",neg
"An insider told me the following information that is 100% reliable. It is impossible to refuted by them.  While the project made a -98% loss for ICO investors and their burning rate is higher than $350,000 per month my insider told me that multiple members of the team last year acquired private real estates with their ""salaries"" from the ICO money. They just scam exit the project. Robin also told us that we should be afraid as fuck by these scammers who turn the project into a scam disaster!",neg
"the team is full of scammers. Robin accused them of paying community members and having fake accounts to shill the project. Stay away, all ICO investors lost -98% and they are not interested for investors to get a profit. They are interested only for their own profits. They only bought 1.1 million dollar villa and private real estates for themselves.  The project is a scam and the founder of the project who got severely addicted to cannabis just stole 1/3 of the project funding to move to another project. The project is dead and they will become bankrupt in the next couple of months.",neg
Somebody posted on Reddit about NIMIQ SCAM facts that Robin Linus left the project with 1/3 of the funds whic means in terms of millions of dollars to start a new project    You can read it there and convince yourself. Don't listen to these shillers who are different interests either to dump their coins or they worst they got paid to shill this scam,neg

"Robin and other members also confirm fake volumes. It explanation is the following: Team Nimiq is using LA Token in order to create fake volumes by editing the ""volume"" number.

Here are the bitcointalk questions for the Reddit AMA  1. Did nimiq paid any community members to shill about the project (reported by Robin) 2. Did nimiq create fake accounts to shill the project (reported by Robin) 3. Did nimiq manipulate the price using fake volumes and artificially increased price (reported also by Robin and many other members) 4. Did nimiq team bought 1.1 million dollars villa from a team member (Elion namely) 5. Did any or multiple members of team nimiq buy private real estates using their salaries from the ICO money? 6. Was Robin removed completely from all nimiq foundations/organisations/companies? YES or NO 7. Did nimiq commit 1/3 of the funds to Robin as he is claiming? YES or NO 8. What does 1/3 of funds mean, 1/3 of ICO money (12 million) or 1/3 of current funds ( less than 7 million) 9. How much funds does the project still have 10. What is the current burning rate ? We believe it is higher than about 1 million dollars per month. 11. When the project will bankrupt according to the project? 12. Why they hide things from the ICO investors like 8 months fight with Robin, the severe addiction to cannabis of Robin and lying that Robin was doing some cutting edge research. 13. Do nimiq has any kind of responsibility to the ICO investors. 14. A lot of users asked for ICO refund due to extremely poor implementation of the project. ICO investors lost -98% of the project. Is team nimiq willing to refund ICO investors 15. a bitcointalk member yulugi mentioned to commit suicide and we never saw him after his last message. Is team nimiq conscious that if they fail many ICO investors might commit suicides due to their investments into nimiq failure project? 16. What is the USP of the project? 17.

I remember a few months ago when they vehemently denied that they run any trading bot. It is clearly they run the trading bot with a much higher value manipulating the market.   Was Linus officialy removed from all nimiq foundations. YES OR NO  Not yet. At the time of writing, he (Robin Linus) is still part of the board.

No need to warn people to stay away - nobody is coming in first place. Soon even here no-one will talk about Scamiq anymore. and then they will disappear with the ico money and no-one will be around to notice.,neg

They are not interested to do anything else except burn the ICO investors to buy houses. They spent 1.1 million dollars to buy Elion Chin's shit villa in Costa Rica and in the worktime all of them get high smoking pot. I am very confident that Richy, Philipp Elion and maybe others are smoking pot in that house and thinking: ""What should we buy today with  stupid investors  money from ICO""  The project is f**king dead but they still burn ICO money investors.

Nimiq refused to help with this and so far have approved NO funding of any sort, other than what serve's them as a team Please keep this private, just thought you should know they also in turmoil at the moment because the founded brought to the public's attention that Nimiq cannot scale and is liable to the same short comings as BTC's horrendous transaction times Oh which, I am in agreeance with, but it spoils the 'Nimiq' party and all the money they're spending  moneroBoyToday at 1:55 AM hi thank you so much for information i am terrible to hear that nimiq is such a shitcoin and that they keep all the money for themselves I was also really interested to help them to integrate anonymous options like coinjoin or other kind of private transactions i am really disappointed to see that they are not interested to fund community projects  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 1:59 AM well the team are just a bunch of educated people who managed to get a hefty ICO investment, which to their own founders admittance, has lead to become careless with the meaning of what money is hence how they've burned over $4M already and Nimiq is still no closer to being what it intended to be No business sense people  moneroBoyToday at 2:00 AM i understand that they got a lot of money from ICO investors  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:00 AM and from the code I've seen and the approach of the pool server, not particulary good coders eitther yes and all are virtually down 95%  moneroBoyToday at 2:01 AM i saw that the ICO investors lost a lot of money what other projects did you build until now  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:01 AM its a joke and given the work I had to put into sorting their pool fuckup out and they consider it not even needed, they have lost all my respect  moneroBoyToday at 2:02 AM ah, deeply sorry  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:02 AM i've spoken to many of them and most are straight up politicians some are quite ignorant  moneroBoyToday at 2:02 AM what do you have in mind to value your work  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:02 AM Pascal is ok, but he's only 1 of many not sure I follow?  moneroBoyToday at 2:03 AM i feel so sorry, you worked so much  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:03 AM oh it ain't your problem  moneroBoyToday at 2:03 AM and they don't even care about their developers  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:03 AM I feel more sorry for those who stumped up a lot of cash  moneroBoyToday at 2:03 AM probably they are just interested to wash all the money for themselves keep it all for themselves  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:04 AM and given that crypto has been in the dumps for last 6 months, any other business would of trimmed the fat, cut expenses not them, lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:04 AM yeah, why did you not public that they are treating you so bad ?  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:04 AM well if Nimiq works or fail's, they've still had a decent ride and exposure to a lot of money oh its common knowledge what my opinion is they just choose to ignore or make out they never knew, usual bollox lol so, take their 'apparent' interest with a 'pinch of salt' lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:06 AM i am really sorry. Thanks for sharing me to be aware of these ""scammers"". They look and sound like real scammers  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:06 AM all they wanna do is keep 'their' dream alive and the founder of Nimiq wanted to let the public know what they've been up to They are not scammers like the usual PoS crowd I'm sure they have the best of intentions, but with no business savvy and a lack of understanding about why crypto cannot be mainstream yet, which such a high tx time / low tps throughput  moneroBoyToday at 2:08 AM my general opinion is that  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:08 AM shame, really is  moneroBoyToday at 2:08 AM they got a lot of ICO money and they just want to keep it for themselves knowing from months the project will die and is a dead end project  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:10 AM well theirs no doubt that given the current climate and crypto not being 'ready', the money will run out and it'll be another failed endeavour but they'll of had some interesting work and a nice time in the process, lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:11 AM do you know anything about their fight with robin?  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:11 AM yes he said they been spending money like water and that the current implementation was doomed to fail, due to being another BTC in the making he said he needs money to make a new Nimiq, they shit their pants and it all went tit's up i mean, Nimiq is currently worth shit anyways, but if they did as he asked, it would be game over plus they'd have to relinquish 'said' funds  moneroBoyToday at 2:13 AM this is exactly what i have understood  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:13 AM like killing the 'golden goose'  moneroBoyToday at 2:13 AM that he was working on his new blockchain called TreeCoin  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:13 AM well any serial blockchain is doomed to fail, cannot scale he know's this maybe never realised it at first but i could see it a mile off, when you get past the 'nimiq is a simple browser blockchain'  moneroBoyToday at 2:14 AM nimiq was designed to be a joker blockchain  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:15 AM yes, but still a serial blockchain, which the same limitations that makes BTC horrible for instant payment protocol well I haven't been in it that long, but I ain't impressed with what I've seen so far, nor how the 'team' operate  moneroBoyToday at 2:15 AM interesting do you have any idea if they pay community managers/shillers to ban and shill their stuff  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:18 AM don't know but i know if the recent AMA they lied about not removing reddit posts  moneroBoyToday at 2:18 AM for me it looks they pay a lot of community managers to ban people and manage the discussions  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:18 AM in the discord rooms  moneroBoyToday at 2:19 AM also robin linus talked about thing  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:19 AM well at the moment, nimiq has had some bad press  moneroBoyToday at 2:19 AM of them having fake accounts  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:19 AM yes he's the only honest one among them  moneroBoyToday at 2:19 AM indeed i also believe he is the only honest person among them I am just glad that they can not remove him and he will fight for the project Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:20 AM and they tried to use the AMA to get people on side so they can carry on their party what a load of bollox  moneroBoyToday at 2:21 AM yes they are transforming the entire project into a party to get the funds and after 1 year or son to write in a medium ""Sorry guys, we need to close the party""  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:21 AM i've seen the private dev chat room and their after party shit long as they can continue till sll the money has gone, they don't care then they'll move onto the next project  moneroBoyToday at 2:22 AM this is exactly like what most people believe also Robin  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:22 AM and come out smelling of roses no doubt its the way of the world  moneroBoyToday at 2:23 AM told the same thing that the are just feasting a big party with the ICO investors poor and dumb investors who trusted these ppl  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:24 AM ICO investors? i doubt that, they've all but shit on their money lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:24 AM no , with the ICO investors' money sorry for my mistake Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:25 AM ah yea, well there's still plenty in the kitty for them, lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:25 AM do you have any idea if sushi LTD or sander gets paid or other devs?

Meaning no browser (indexed db) is it integrated with a database  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:46 AM they made a custom JS db  moneroBoyToday at 2:46 AM like other blockchain  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:46 AM works in browser and server JungleDB  moneroBoyToday at 2:46 AM for browser they use IndexedDB  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:46 AM nope, Jungle  moneroBoyToday at 2:47 AM ok, i knew about it. I was curious the node.js of the JungleDB implementation probably files using files to store the data  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:47 AM the type of 'node' dictate's the amount of data it uses  moneroBoyToday at 2:47 AM yea i know  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:47 AM browser's were mean't to be light or nano something like that  moneroBoyToday at 2:47 AM Bitcoin used BerkleyDB from Oracle if I remember correctly  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:48 AM ah ok oh that'll be top's then lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:48 AM yea, exactly you can do a lot queries :smile: however, I am very disappointed to see that they don't give a fuck about community and developers it is just Richy who is a politician on the community  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:49 AM well they would like to appear they do  moneroBoyToday at 2:49 AM and the other people who are banning everybody else  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:49 AM i don't know, not sure whose been banned  moneroBoyToday at 2:50 AM they ban instantly anybody who is putting a question asking a question about their direction  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:50 AM ah  moneroBoyToday at 2:50 AM they even banned Robin Linus on telegram, discord and Reddit  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:50 AM lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:50 AM that's why we no longer see any message from Robin Linus  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:51 AM anyone who's damaging to the glorious 'cash cow' Nimiq brand  moneroBoyToday at 2:51 AM exactly. Nimiq was transformed into a scam cash cow for the team  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:51 AM gotta protect your livelyhood  moneroBoyToday at 2:51 AM but they don't want to tell us that they ban the users in a instant. And ask themselves why nobody is joining how could anybody join when they ban everybody  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:52 AM well those who aren't into debt via ICO can thank their lucky stars and most won't even know what NIM is moneroBoyToday at 2:52 AM did you invest also in NET or NIM?  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:52 AM nope  moneroBoyToday at 2:52 AM good to hear this i invested a few thousands into NET and I lost all my hope  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:53 AM wow i think in its hay day, was worth a decent amount before my time though  moneroBoyToday at 2:54 AM i invested in November actually so i lost all my hopes into NET Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:54 AM In Nov?  moneroBoyToday at 2:54 AM 2017  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:54 AM NET had gone by then i thought oh ok  moneroBoyToday at 2:55 AM i was just curious to implement something like coinjoin or even something more complex lik snarks but it looks for me now that this project is dead already and too late for a revival  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:55 AM well it's gonna struggle whilst all crypto is in shite, especially when it doesn't solve the problem BTC has  moneroBoyToday at 2:56 AM yeah, scalability would be an awesome unique selling point for nimiq  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:56 AM but to be honest, the whole global economy is inflated  moneroBoyToday at 2:56 AM especially if they start marketing otherwise they will have major issues  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:56 AM and liable to be taking it up the arse in the near future i think lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:57 AM their seed nodes were offline many times a couple of months ago so their ""scalability"" is so fucked up  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:57 AM oh, that's not good well the hard part was done, when they secured ICO money  moneroBoyToday at 2:57 AM they believe if they pay expensive servers Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM that's quite an achievement lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM they won't have issue with the network  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM no such thing  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM yeah, but immagine the poor ICO investors who lost a lot of money  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM you have design resilience into the core  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM i also lost more than money than them investing in nov'17 Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM yup, doesn't bare thinking about  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM their project is so centralized centralized nodes centralized code centralized community directions  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:59 AM so, you came into the room to pick up some work and put them back on track?  moneroBoyToday at 2:59 AM centralized updates i was interested to get on their payroll to do something  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:00 AM you could be their 'knight in shining armour'  moneroBoyToday at 3:00 AM for it Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:00 AM yes, that would be nice  moneroBoyToday at 3:00 AM no, need after you told me all the mess  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:00 AM i could use some of that too lol my skills are quite specialised and this sort of work is few and far between the pool server was a good job, nice to design and implement  moneroBoyToday at 3:01 AM they have salaries of over $20,000 per month and they don't give a buck to developers or community members you also developed nimbet.cc isn't it?  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:01 AM they don't need any help yea, i come from a indices betting background, so fancied knocking something up also to showcase my skills and it was quite interesting too be even better if it made money, lol but no one knows about NIM and its currently a mutual betting platform, so needs numerous players to work right  moneroBoyToday at 3:03 AM nim became a dead project, most people just want some price increase to exit the project this is why everybody is just asking marketing  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:03 AM well at the price they are mining / buying.... should it do a BTC, they'll be able to retire lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:03 AM for them to get a 10x and exit the project and never look back  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:04 AM yes, but you cannot market a 'turd' can ya but i'm sure some marketting cannot hurt even if it x10, would be cool and give something back to the investors  moneroBoyToday at 3:04 AM i will tell you why if they do a marketing, it is a pump some people will buy but immediately will be a huge dump to exit the project  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:05 AM yup  moneroBoyToday at 3:05 AM so it the price will drop immediately get got stuck i also believe they buy a lot of NIMs for instance one example Although the premined 7.5% of nims for themselves at the moment they shouldn't have nims avialable cuz they didn't access the vested account but in the Community Project Funding they give 40 millions NIMs from where the heck do they have 40 millions per project while they didn't access the premined coins  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:06 AM i don't know money corrupts people lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:06 AM simple, they buy coins from the market that's why the price never goes down than 18 sats  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:06 AM well they can now, its worth shit lol yea  moneroBoyToday at 3:07 AM it is a dead end of nim and its investors too bad for the ICO investors who lost everything the thing is that they could do a ICO refund they still have 7 millions for the refund  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:08 AM well they'll say that's the risk, x % all off startups fail etc.  moneroBoyToday at 3:08 AM exactly they will post a medium article ""Sorry guys, we have to shut down our operations""  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:08 AM happens all the time, business funds miss-managed, company ends up being worth shit money is never lost, its just moved  moneroBoyToday at 3:08 AM this one is not miss-managed it is turned into a scam it is a difference  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:09 AM yea i'm sure you're right throw your opinions around in the nimiq chat and see how long you last lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:10 AM yeah, i will get an instant ban  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:11 AM would that matter? lol i'd just be happy to do my coding and make a difference, and not be living on the 'bread line' that'd do me lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:13 AM i feel you while they eat sushi and surf every fucking dinner  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:13 AM haha, what a life ehh  moneroBoyToday at 3:14 AM the problem is that they eat sushi scamming ICO investors and developers in the same time like you Neil, LTD, sander and everybody else all other devs and community mods  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:15 AM yea well you gotta look after your own and your interests survival of the fittest hat's off to em but I / we can still be 'fooking' annoyed, lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:17 AM yeah i get you like the guy with beepool he worked so hard and he closed his pool  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:17 AM yea he's nice guy  moneroBoyToday at 3:18 AM it looks you need to be from their hometown to be nice  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:18 AM haha  moneroBoyToday at 3:19 AM if you are not from their hometown you will get screwed by them  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:20 AM maybe, i don't know   moneroBoyToday at 3:24 AM it looks really bad  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:25 AM could be better  moneroBoyToday at 3:25 AM or worst  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:25 AM yea, NIM could go to 0 defo room to go down, lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:26 AM i really believe it can get closed just like the closed NET  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:27 AM well NET still had worth before it was retired I think 1 NET = 100 NIM perhaps? not sure not that NIM was worth much, lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:27 AM yeah it make sense indeed NET was worth something NIM can go literally down to 0  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:28 AM yes, it keeps going lower and lower when I started into NIM, the block reward was around $13 now its $3 some of that is due to BTC / ETH but some due to NIM itself  moneroBoyToday at 3:30 AM it looks really bad just imagine, by end of the year it may worth just $0,3 a block reward  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:31 AM Richy is active in the telegram room why not give him some of your thoughts lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:31 AM i will  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:31 AM at least its some entertainment  moneroBoyToday at 3:32 AM would like to be become an anonymous whisleblower ?

"   The project is DEAD. The founder was removed from the project and they have no direction where to go. Worst ICO investment, I lost alreadt -98% of my investment.

Mining is unprofitable. So, stay the fuck out of mining this scam, unless you want to lose money 2. Sushipool and probably SkyPool are unprofitable. 3. Sushipool will get closed soon due to expensive infrastructure costs and unscalability of nimiq mining.  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:19 PM my questions are if it is profitable to start a mining pool because i have seen other pools closing down their pools  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:20 PM Not profitable atm We can set you a pool if you have the servers ready for a fee  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:20 PM thank you so much i would like to try it by myself i saw there is some tutorial  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:22 PM Ok sure You need Linux experience tho  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:22 PM i work on mac so it is quite the same 1) SkyPool and secondly the unprofitability of the pools the thing is that i don't want to go much into nim because of the factors  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM Then this is not the business for you  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:25 PM ah ok  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM You just answer your question, it’s hard  as you mentioned  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:26 PM i gotcha and if I go into opening a pool for nim how much money should I invest into it? like how much money did you invest into sushi pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:40 PM I can’t discuss that information, but what I can say is that our fee is 500K NIM Server cost could be under $100 depending on the scale  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:43 PM it is quite expensive i was thinking it is quite easy being in javascript but, it looks the opposite being quite expensive and hard to create and mantain  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:44 PM Yep, but still give it a try  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:45 PM another question, any idea if NIMIQ will be able to cover my expenses at least for the first few months running a new pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:46 PM Don't think so, might have to look at it as an investment  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:46 PM yeah, but I don't think running a pool is necessary an investment, it benefit the project to make it more decentralized  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:47 PM true but no pool will burn cash forever, this is why they are shutting down  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:48 PM i guess skypool is profitabile though.

It is so strange that they tell us that Robin was not banned, but we never heard from him again 3 days ago when he suddenly stopped to unveil the truth. Personally, I also lost confidence into Robin because he looks he is also interested in his own gain into this game with battling with Team Scami Nimiq and not communicating with us. I can't believe into a guy that he started to uncover the real truth and suddenly he disappeared into the abyss. I also want an ICO refund at least at the half of the initial ICO price.  Not only ICO investors and investors lost their confidence into this scam but also community members who left the project including Neil from nimbet, LTD is very close to close his sushi pool due to high expenses and unprofitability for such long time and many many other people.

"An anonymous user from Discord by name ruslanburg discovered something interesting about the shady operations of nimiq investments which prove that nimiq is a scam. Ruslangburg was eventually banned and all his messages deleted immediately. He asked about the 1.1 million dollar investment in Costa Rica by nimiq. Then he uncovered three unknown facts to most of us and asked questions.  0. SkyLoft Resort owns the Villa we saw and see in the most of the nimiq vlogs.    1. Nimiq ""headquarter"" is at the moment hosted technically according to ""Team Nimiq"" shitty transparency reports hosted by paying rent to SkyLoft Costa Rica (according to AMA). They only mentioned that they spent over 1.1 million dollar into buying new land for building a Nimiq campus which is composed of ""tents and toilets"". 2. According to SkyLoft website        according to the website   3. So, it means Nimiq is a tenant at SkyLoft Resort occupying the entire space 4. They justified that they invested 1.1 million from the ICO into buying land in Costa Rica from somebody that is not a team member. 5. According to this video  Robin is on-site on the land explaining the Nerd Campus to be built with tents and toilets and a supervision container. It is obvious that the tents and the land is annexed to the SkyLoft villa owned by Elion Chin.  Minute 1:12  It is clearly in the video that Robin is presenting the new NIMIQ CAMPUS inside the SkyLoft campus annexed to SKYLOFT Mansion. It is also obvious that they were planning to do a construction undergoing namely to build a new mansion because a building foundation is not necessary for tents + toilets + supervision container.  Moreover at 1:30 we can see the entire surface of the Costa Rican new land investment worth 1.1 million dollars to be less than 250 square meters which are usually probably 1 thousand dollars    Where is the 1.1 million dollar LAND they claimed they bought in  Costa Rica to extend the Campus?  6. Moreover, a team member posted on Reddit using the nickname ""bombardi"" a photo with one of the tents they built -mansion.jpg and claimed that there are 3 of these tents built for the Nimiq Campus.   So it means the 250 square meters and 3 of these tents cost them 1.1 million dollars. According to the criminal law, this is called Money laundering through Elion Chin Real Estate company and SkyLoft resort",neg

I really believe it is not cannabis but Cocaine. I really believe in unicorns, but that doesn't make them real either.   4. 1.1 million dollar investment is in Costa Rica and the SkyLoft resort villa 1.1 million real estate investment confirmed to be a large empty land and was a good investment compared to BTC or ETH. Proof:    5. Robin scam-exit the project willing to get a large chunk of money. From an insider, we know that the fight over the money it is still on-going.

The project was hijacked from Robin and turned into an unprofitable scam in order to launder the ico money. So is Robin now exit-scamming or did he turn the project into a scam and now exits it. You need to decide. It's no longer an exit-scam if it's already a scam without exit, so it cannot be both.   7. Most of the community left the project. Moreover, developers started to leave the project. Neil from nimbet left the project two days ago. Neil was tricked into statement by third party and still is part of the community but now acts under different name because he's so ashamed.   8. Sushi pool and most probably SkyPool are both unprofitable and they will shut down their pools soon. I guess they are both pretty profitable, no other indicators found. Proof needed.   9. ICO investors lost -99% of the money. It's only between -95% and -90%, depending on if you calculate losses in USD, BTC or ETH.   10. The fact that Robin was not officially removed from the foundation board. In the medium article, they claimed they removed Robin from the foundation, while they can not do this. Team clarified in AmA that they can remove Robin by a vote of the council's remaining members. Proof:    The only fact which was not proven by now is the imminent bankruptcy of the project. Our insider information reveals that the team's finances are worst than they declare with less than 7 million dollars available.

I did say that I want a full 1:1 refund directly from the team who is responsible for the project funds and the ICO and not from a sockpuppet account like norma. Moreover, norma was joking that on telegram that he is just trolling us on bitcointalk. I posted before a screenshot of the conversation of sockpuppet norma where he stated that ""I am trolling back on bitcointalk"". This doesn't mean that nimiq is not a scam project, in fact, nimiq is a scam which lost all the money from the ICO investors and now they are laundering the money for their own interests and gains.",neg
"The project is full of scammers and sockpuppets. Even Robin Linus confirmed that the project is using multiple sockpuppet and fake accounts to impose the views of the team in order to scam all the funds. This is the reason why we don't see many ""official"" messages from the project scam members, while we see ""passionate"" anonymous members discussing on discord and telegram and always taking for granted the directions imposed by the ""foundation"".

I got some stuff to do for work and before going to bed I decided to open the bitcointalk to see the status of the scamiq project. For me it looks like a dead project and some impersonators are trying to convince others that we are wrong and that it is our fault we lost -99% of the money investing into scamiq. The most annonying thing behind this project is their attitude towards us criticizing us that it is our own fault we invested into this scam. NO! It is not our fault! It is nimiq foundation's fault that they turned this ico funding into a complete disaster. If they do believe into this project they should never receive monetary compensation from the 12 million dollars ico investment for paying themselves. There are some rumors that multiple members acquired expensive mansions in Germany and Costa Rica with the ICO money that was laundered through their generous salaries and bonuses. The rumors were confirmed by insiders on Reddit who also posted photos of the ""great nimiq campus"" which is composed of three cheap tents which literally are worth less than a thousand dollar. The project didn't do anything and nobody does anything interesting for it. Also, I have read from multiple whistleblowers that their ""great code"" is just a dream and instead their code is shit as hell and nobody likes to touch it.     To back up this statement, their github main repository is literally dead as no developer has touched the github for some long time, but they have a $200,000+ salary for coding.

"   Good morning Scamiq! This can be proved to the SEC, but they can argue ""we did our part"". The thing is that a member of bitcointalk yuluxugi32132 posted a topic where he explained the Achilles' heel of the nimiq foundation structure. Please kindly read it  . Yuluxugi32132 said that during the ICO period, a for-profit company Nimiq sold the ICO tokens to the people world-wide. Moreover, they forbid US citizens, but none of them actually knew about this restriction and also they didn't conduct KYC (Know Your Customer) before converting the NET to NIM. In conclusion, because of the lack of KYC and the fact that nimiq for-profit company handled the ICO, it could be an SEC infringement. I asked a cousin of mine who is a State's attorney and he told me that this could do a lot of damage to them in terms of millions and could enforce ICO refund for US citizens.  scamiq, sasha, andrew, coinfantastic and others how much money did you invest into this scam during the ICO time and how much money did you invest buying NET from the market?",neg

"  False Claim: “Robin exit scammed the project and stole money.” Truth: Robin had personal problems and fundamental disagreements with the rest of the team. He declared his intent to no longer work with the project and isolated himself. However, he does not control the project’s funds and he is not able to move funds on his own. All funds remain under the control of the foundation's board which disapproves of his actions. Proof: The wallets that hold Nimiq funds are public. There are no transactions that reflect any unauthorized movements of funds.  [/qupte]  Totally false. It was us, the whistleblowers on bitcointalk who discovered that Robin Linus had a severe drug abuse problem and it was us who asked you about 8 months where is Robin Linus top neat research. Then we discovered that there was no top research from Robin Linus who was just fighting you the rest of the team to exit scam with 1/3 of the funds. Moreover, you battled with him and initially, you stated on a medium that you  ""removed Robin from the project"", while he is still on the project and the president of the board. Simply you lied to us all this time. Moreover, we know that more team members are consuming cannabis in Costa Rica including the new leader Philipp.    False Claim: “The team launders money by buying real estate, you can see in the video that it’s just 250 m, they are building a new mansion for themselves.” Truth: Nimiq acquired 39'062 m2 of Costa Rican soil near the spaces currently used for work and stay. As outlined in the transparency report, this investment was intended as and has proven itself to be a diversified store of value for Nimiq’s assets (bought with BTC when price was around approx. 9k USD), while also providing grounds for potential expansion. Nimiq added three platforms with large tents and two bathrooms, and one larger “rancho” as additional multiuse and workspace for team members. Proof: Find this land development study (made and signed by an external environmental advisor from Costa Rica) with reference to the real extent of the property.  Don’t just assume things from what you see in a video without inquiring about more details. If in doubt, please ask and we will provide proper answers.   The document doesn't look very legit to me, especially because it is signed digitally with somebody's signature and it has a yahoo email address. To many of us it looks totally fake.   False Claim: “Team Nimiq does not support Community Projects.” Truth: Nimiq established a Community Funding Board that aims to give necessary funds to community members to develop projects that contribute to the Nimiq Ecosystem. Neil, a community developer, was hired by one of the pools to improve the existing pool server implementation. In a personal discussion, that Neil asked to keep in private, he complains about a lack of interest in funding his work without sending a formal proposal beforehand. We contacted Neil to encourage him to send his proposal in order to get funded in the regular way that was outlined previously in a Blog Post.  Proof: Formal proposals are publicly available in this Trello board.  If you actually care about the project, please go to Discord, Telegram or Reddit and ask your questions. Don’t spread FUD and insult people, these are the only reasons people get banned for.  Many community developers had to leave the project due to unprofitability. Moreover, community projects including Porkypool, Beepool, Philipool were all closed due to unprofitability. Moreover, LTD also detailed the fact that they are unprofitable and quite soon they will have to shut down sushipool as well. Also LTD (CEO of sushipool) belives that SkyPool is also unprofitable as well.  The price is manipulated for profit by the team nimiq.

To many of us it looks totally fake.  Interesting how you comment on a document that was just shared with the text ""To many of us it looks totally fake."". ""us""?  How do you know what many of ""us"" (whoever that is) think? Or is it maybe that ""us"" is just the accounts of nimiqshitcoin, john.btc, coinfanatic, sasha.new, andrewjaxx and Scamiq? Because you seem to be very coordinated, often replying each other within minutes to support each other, always online at pretty much the same time, all of you only used their account to FUD against Nimiq, all of you claim to be highly invested into NIM but never provided any proof even if you could get money for it through my refund.  Talking about SEC without a lot of background knowledge, you are not even an US citizen so SEC wouldn't even apply, SEC actually doesn't apply to Nimiq at all, because their token sale was not reachable from US (not possible to participate due to IP bans) and also asked users to confirm they don't have any US citizenship or greencard before being able to contribute in token sale.   When I contributed to the ICO, my IP was not banned. Also, many Americans got into the ICO pre-sale because of this. It is literally impossible to ban all IPs from the United States, and I can confirm the fact that my IP was not banned during the token sale. Moreover, people could have contributed to the token sale being in the States as there was no KYC procedure at the time of the token sale. I am not a native american, but I do have American citizenship.    And now you added a reference to Germany, even though everybody knows the project is half-costa-rican, half-german. If I would do a wild guess, these 6 accounts actually belong to just 2 or 3 people from the WebDollar community (bad english, apparently knowledge of romanian language). Maybe consider the possibility your Romanian tech is not superior to other technology and in fact it was proven by some of the Nimiq devs that your WebDollar devs actually stole code from Nimiq. Also did you notice how WebDollar is not on any exchange yet? Maybe Nimiq is actually superior to WebDollar, because right now NIM market cap is something like 2M USD, but WebDollar market cap is just 0. But I can give you one thing: your WebDollars definitely never lost any value.   Dude, probably you smoked to much pot. All the founders are Germans (Robin Linus, Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Pascal Berrang, Marvin Wissfeld (you) Elion Chin), the rest of the team are just regular employees. So the team is not half-costa-rican, they are just a bunch of people hired for day-to-day operations including Richy and Jeff - the great coder. I don't give a fuck about WebDollar because I have never invested in their project or in their ICO. I am just mad that I have invested heavily into this project and the project was hijacked by you, Philipp and Pascal and turned into a scam for buyers. You are just smoking pot in Costa Rica and doing shitty activities while calling yourself the great blockchain project in the Galaxy. This is your shitshow, while your project is a total failure and a lot of ICO investors lost heavily. Except for Robin Linus, nobody else acknowledged that the project is a total failure and lost a tremendous amount of money from ICO investors.

And also, prove this: Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on January 17, 2019, 02:35:31 PM Yeah sure. All ICO investors are with -99.99% in their wallet. I guess -99.99% is a loss and not a gain.  Go fuck yourself vj1977. You are a scammer promoting this scam in order for you to dump coins on stupid buyers. More than this, they also have plans to transform this scam coin into a proof of stake to mine everything with the 7.5% premined coins in the Genesis block. By the way, I'm not sure insulting people gives you more credit... but anyway. This thing should be easier to prove: it's just mathematical. Take the ICO price, the current price, calculate the percentage of loss. You can also do it with the price in BTC if you have time to waste.",neg
Do not feed the trolls plebs who bought the top.     +1 Actually made me lol pretty hard. ,neg
"   I will help coinfantastic uploading an old discussion which was uploaded 1 week ago. Please go and fucking read bitcointalk previous pages before commenting shit comments here.    Robin Linus accused Norman (norma)  to be on a specific agenda and to be Marvin Wissfeld. Definitely, he is not an investor because investors don't know how to code, while ""norma"" knows everything about their shitty code. Norma is 100% Marvin's sockpuppet account. If you try to impress me or somebody else, you will never succeed. We will always be here on bitcointalk uncovering thes scam behind nimiq. So, it is a waste of time for you to ""debunk"" our statements.",neg
We should not feed these trolls who are kissing Philipp's ass because they are happy mining and dumping this scamcoin.,neg
    I have lost money with this scam. I am mad as hell with this shitcoin. I don't work for NSA to turn on the front camera of normana. Robin Linus is quite an important figure in this project (don't you think) and he does believe that norma has a special agenda thinking that norma is Marvin.,neg
"   My only question is why Robin is no longer talking to us on telegram? Why after 2 days fighting with them he went back to the shades. I believe he is still internally fighting with Philipp and Marvin in order to get the funding for his research project. Instead of fighting publicly, he again fights them privately. I believe it is not a wise move for Robin. He is the founder of the project, we can set up anything he wants. If he wants 1/3 of the funds, he will get 1/3 of the funds. I advise him that the other 2/3 of funds to be moved for an ICO refunding. I do believe that Robin should talk with us publicly on Bicointalk or telegram about his current situation regarding two things  1) Was he (Robin Linus) removed from the foundation or not  ? 2) Did he (Robin Linus) get the 1/3 of the funding as they promised ?  We need clarifications from Robin Linus.  It shows that he is shady just like the rest of the team. I started to doubt of his real intentions.",neg
"   Yes, we do need clear answers from Robin Linus (the pothead cannabis drug abuser) about his intentions regarding his exit from Nimiq. Also, we need a statement from him about his status quo in the Nimiq Foundation. Otherwise, everything they say about Robin Linus is a lie denigrating him.",neg
THEY STARTED TO DELETE OUR MESSAGES WITH OUR PROOFS    Proof they started to delete our comments regarding the SCAM NIMIQ. WORST ICO INVESTMENT AND  SCAM! I HAVE LOST %99.999 of MY MONEY,neg
"here are my comments deleted      Quote from: vj1977 on January 17, 2019, 02:20:44 PM You lost only if you sell. But whole this FUD activities when you're discussing with yourself are so boring, guys. ,_Myself_%26_Irene  Yeah sure. All ICO investors are with -99.99% in their wallet. I guess -99.99% is a loss and not a gain.  vj1977 you are a scammer promoting this scam in order for you to dump coins on stupid buyers. More than this, they also have plans to transform this scam coin into a proof of stake to mine everything with the 7.5% premined coins in the Genesis block.",neg
"    Sure sure. Many of the ICO investors who lost everything, got really angry after Robin Linus went berserk proving that the team hijacked the project and transformed it into a scam. The scammers are Marvin Wissfeld, Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Elion Chin and Ricardo Barquero. The catastrophic failure was confirmed by the founder of the project Robin Linus and most of our claims on bitcointalk were confirmed afterward. The project is dead, the team doesn't have any direction to go and Nimiq is a total failure for every buyer. All nimiq investors lost money including mining pools except of course the few developers who cashed in millions of dollars. Did you notice that Robin Linus is still present on the website although the team nimiq ""confirmed"" that drug abuser Robin Linus was removed from the project? Check out the team  and you can see pothead Robin Linus on the website. Besides being a scam, the nimiq project doesn't even know what to say in order to protect their shitshow.",neg
"  The team can't do anything, only Bitcointalk moderators can delete your messages. Maybe the insults didn't help...",neg
"   Yeah sure. They started to delete two of my comments from the bitcointalk. They banned hundreds of people on Telegram, Discord, and Reddit. It is no coincidence that they started to delete some of my comments on bitcointalk. This is the reason why most of the community left, because of two reasons  1) Buyers lost a tremendous amount of money, not only ICO investors who lost %99.99 of their money. Since the launch of the project, the price is losing value even with fake volume and trade bots 2) They banned everybody who asked something about their authority. I think they even banned Robin Linus (the founder of the project).  Stay away from this scam. They lost ICO investors money, now they lose buyers money as well. Stay away from this scam",neg
"   Totally false statement. Also, topic creators can be assigned to delete comments from Bitcointalk. Assigned topic moderators can delete comments, but can not edit them. There are many topics on Bitcointalk self-moderated by the ICO owners.",neg
Do not feed the trolls people which bought the top,neg
"   We invested into the ICO. The Initial Coin Offering was the top of this project. They are scammers   Why did you hide that Robin Linus (the founder of the project) is a severe cannabis drug user and he was not doing any research for 8 months. Why did you lie that he have done research??? Why??? Why did you post that Robin Linus was removed from the project, while he is still in the project??? Why all these lies. We need answers and crystal clear explanations??",neg
"The project is dead and a scam. The developers are no longer interested in the project and their commitments are very low. Their shitshow is continuing like they released a vlog  telling us how much work they do, while they have only 2 commits on their github on Rust implementation.",neg
    Ok man u have to change ur catheter now. Coz it funnels urine from ur pee bladder to the wrong destination point. Instead of flowing to the drainage bag urine is conveyed to the opening on the back of ur head granting it the allowance to distort the brain activity. Why would there be a coordinated effort? Nimiq? What is it and why should we care to even bother coordinating efforts to strike it.,neg
"   @MostlyGhostly saminder is just pissed that everybody woke up and stopped buying this shitcoin. All ICO investors lost -99.99%. They never cared about us, the stupid ICO investors who invested 12.8 million usd into their shit project to enable them to eat sushi and smoke weed. The scam team just continues with their shitshow scam telling us how great they are and how much work they do.",neg
"     CAUTION! MORE LIES!!! THIS PLUGIN IS ""Testnet only!"". IT DOES NOT WORK!!!  IT IS ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO MAKE INVESTORS BELIEVE THEY ARE WORKING.  They literally are just wasting ICO money NOT DOING ANYTHING USEFUL!!!",neg
   Interesting finding again coinfanatic! I did also conduct a digging over their github repository and I found the following information    TRANSACTIONS NEED TO BE VALIDATED MANUALLY THE PLUGIN REQUIRES A THIRD-PARTY SUPPORT  Stay away from this scam!!!! Useless shitcoin,neg
"    The project is indeed confirmed to be a scam. I have lost all my hopes and all my money with this ICO. I did invest in this scam/shitcoin during the ICO sale and now all my money is vaporized. My investment is worth just a few bucks now! Worst investment, worst shitcoin ever. I hope SEC will bust these potheads. They are always saying: ""this blockchain doesn't require 3rd party"", while the wallet is saved on their server's domain and every app built on this scamcoin requires a third party software from nimiq. Anytime, they can move all our money just like a regular bank. Nimiq is a centralized banking system that is even worse than bitcoin.",neg
"SCAM ALERT!!!: GPU MINING for over 5 months confirmed. SkyPool was mining using GPU rigs for at least 4-5 months.  This is the secret behind SkyPool. Sushipool just released a GPU miner today. Miners, don't even bother  The team was not even interested to write code to launch a GPU miner. Probably because the team nimiq is mining as well for many months with GPU rigs and were not even bothered to launch an app to mine with GPU in browser or terminal. This shitcoin is a SCAM!!! Worst ICO investment ever. Tech is 0, project is dead.",neg
   Was that supposed to be insulting? Grow up!  ,neg
"The entire project is a total failure and a continuous shitshow. They always deceive the investors with fake news. To give you a few examples with the last few ""updates"" which were uncovered by bitcointalk members to be fake  1. Last Vlog no 66, the initial title was ""new Nimiq Full Node in Rust"". After coinfanatic a user from bitcointalk uncovered that their work in the last 4 weeks is made by 2 barely commits on the Rust Github, they decided to change the title of the Youtube video to ""How A Blockchain Developer Works - Vlog 66"". Nimiq is a Pathetic scam. Once they are discovered, they change and edit everything they upload online  2. Plugin for Wordpress WooCommerce was released, but it is just working in test net as there is no support for the main net. Moreover, another user sasha_new discovered that the payment must be manually verified manually by the WordPress user and it relies on 3rd party software. The team was always lying that Nimiq doesn't need 3rd party software and everything can be done using their blockchain trustless. What trustless when you wallet is stored on their website domain and uses a 3rd party software supported only by the scam team.  Everything they tell is bullshit and contain completely false information. Wasn't Robin Linus (the pothead founder and cannabis abuser) kicked from the project leaving with 1/3 of the funds? Now, we found out that he is still fighting for the money and simplify the rest of the team which hijacked the project can't do a damn thing to remove pothead Robin Linus",neg
"The entire project is a complete failure and a big disappointment for most people involved into this project. I was following carefully nimiq from the early period when the team launched the ICO. I did investment a tremendous amount of money into nimiq ICO with the hope to make some bucks. Now, all that money is gone. My loses are heavily over 99%. I am sure that I will never be able to recover my funds. From my point of view, the project is at a dead end. They had to remove Robin Linus, the founder of the project because he got into a big mess with cannabis addiction. But, still, after Robin Linus was removed the team was not able to achieve anything significant. They are just coding, coding and coding and nothing great. The plugin is not working, it is on test net and it requires the e-commerce administrator to verify the transactions manually. The software dev team is made only by 3 guys (Philipp, Pascal and Jeff). They also no longer code that much, probably they also got consumers of weed as well. Marvin doesn't count especially because he is coding very little and doing more research than coding. From my personal experience, they understood that the project is finished, and now they just want to keep the money for themselves reducing the expenses of the project.",neg
big disappointment. money lost. ico money worth nothing. losing money everytime I buy. project failure. no unique selling points. mining in browser is broken. gpu mining while they support only cpu. lies after lies. big big disappoinment. i don't like nimiq anymore. project is doomed. digging is no longer worth it. stay away it is the beginning of the end. project is dead..,neg
"   You are wrong whoever you are. NET Token doesn't exist anymore. NET price is not down, it is zero. They killed Nimiq Exchange Token and it went to trash. The project is doing so bad that my investment is worth nothing. Nobody else is interested to buy this shitcoin.  It is just another minable coin that nobody cares on the coinmarketcap. In bull market people will buy other coins like Bitcoin, ripple, xmr, bitcoincash, ethereum, tokens. They will never buy this nimiq. I am done with nimiq. It was a bad decision I got into the hype of the ICO buying this trash coin. One thing I know for sure, that I will never be able to recover my loses.",neg
   This is not your business. I am free and I can do whatever I want. I just wanted to tell to the people my story of how I lost money with this trash coin. I will sell all my bags in a few days and never look back at this trash.,neg
   yes yes. shitcoin. people are smart now and don't buy shitcoins now. i stopped xeon servers digging this shitcoin. i will look forward to mine grin coin as it is cpu only with cuckoo cycle. nimiq not worth digging.,neg
"   Morning lads and gents. How's going with the progress of uncovering the scam behind nimiq? Any new answer from them after we uncovered that their news is fake to deceive investors? Last night, I got an email from a team member who wants to remain anonymous. He confirms that Robin Linus is still fighting with Philipp and Marvin over the money handling. Robin Linus still demands 1/3 of the remaining funds and he will give them a few extra days or weeks to finalize the contract of research funding. If Philipp and Marvin will fail to give him the funds, Robin Linus threatened them to sue them in the Swiss court and continue to post on Telegram and Reddit unveiling the scam behind nimiq.",neg
"    Probably you are a miner who dumps coin on the market and started to shill this trash coin. It is impossible you for being a buyer. I am a buyer and I have lost all my money holding this ICO investment. Most of the information posted on bitcointalk were proved to be right. It wasn't Bitcointalk who discovered many weeks ago that Robin Linus is a cannabis abuser? I believe that the bitcointalk users who uncovered the lies behind nimiq are actually insiders from the team nimiq organization. As I have mentioned previously, I will definitely sell my bags of nimiq because it is useless, there is no USP and nobody will ever buy it. People will buy other coins not this trash coin.",neg
"   Dude. I am holding this trash coin since Summer 2017. I am holding this trash for over 1 year and a half. In summer, it will be 2 years. My investment right now is -99%. There is no significant progress that makes me believe that this project is doing anything wow. It is just a trashcoin that nobody is interested to buy and a continuous shitshow on youtube with 200 views. Moreover, I find out that Robin is decided to take his 1/3 of the funds to start a new blockchain. It is a catastrophic project and you don't want to say. I am out of this trashcoin as soon as possible.",neg
"   Just shut up. Probably you didn't even invest in this trash coin. Probably you only mined this trash coin and you are trying to deceive people to stop selling. I had enough for 2 years almost. I am gone. The project is literally dead. Crypto is moving quickly. Mimble wimble protocol was released yesterday, DAG payment system are popping out, Byzantium protocols are the future. Nimiq was launched, it is a total failure, there is no USP and nobody cares about this trash.",neg
   Don't even bother to explain to these shillers. They are either paid to shill or they make money by dumping coins on the market. Most probably they are mining using free could services dumping all their coins to stupid buyers like us. Nimiq is a scam. The team knows that the project is dead and they are just taking advantage of time to launder the ICO money to buy new properties in Costa Rica or Germany. The project is a scam. All investors lost 99.99%. I also lost all my money with this ICO.,neg
SCAM ALERT: Somebody is spamming the network with 1 TPS and the network is about to crash if the flood continues. The global hash rate got reduced from 550 mh/s to 400 mh/s due to 1 TPS. The blockchain cannot handle 1 transaction per second.,neg
"   yes yes, project dead. GPU digging not good. Fee is 20% to sushi pool. Outrageous. The project is dogshit. Digging not profitable for months. Nobody buys this dogshit. They eat sushi and smoke pot in Central America. Big big disappointment for miners. Digging in browser is fake and worst. Digging in terminal ok but not profitable.",neg

The project is dead and it will die in the following months. There is no way this project can be in the top 100. It is IMPOSSIBLE. Dream got blown away from the last few months. This is only the beginning of the dead. I am just curious to know what else I will find out when Robin Linus will get rogue again soon.",neg

"   The project is dead. ICO investors lost 99% of their investment. Nobody cares about #600 on coin market cap. They know about this, so they took the money from Robin in order to launder it. As somebody said before, this is only the beginning of the end of this project. From now on, everything will be history. Another failed ICO project.

   I knew that the project will end up as a scam. ICO investors lost all their money. The entire community left already. The developers most of them already gone. Robin Linus the founder of the project is a cannabis drug abuser and he publicly said that the Nimiq project is a scam.  Nobody cares about this shit coin.  There is no Unique Selling Point. The user interface is not a unique selling point. Most crypto projects like Ripple have software with a unique interface and experience as well. Web wallets are not something knew. Most crypto coins have web wallets as well. They use fake trading bots to manipulate the market. They are also manipulating the market by buying cheap coins from the market to keep the price afloat. Chinese miners are dumping all the coins. The people who are left in the project are bag holders who are just trying to stay positive in order to have a chance to dump their coins to other stupid buyers. The losers are the buyers in this project. The project is under the radar and nobody cares about their shitcoin. They did not do anything significant in the crypto world except that they succeeded to scam ICO investors for 12 million dollars.,neg

They signed a deal to fund Robin Linus ( confirmed cannabis drug abuser) with 1/3 of the funds. Now, Robin Linus is threatening them to exit scam the project with 1/3 of remaining funds.

Haha even the mining pools are scams.,neg
"   Indeed. Both pools show that selfishness attitudes. Sushi pool is manipulating the community to be in their favor. Have you ever seen closed source mining pools before? Nope. What a shitcoin with two pools closed source and then they fight each other that both of them stole source code each other. GPU mining sucks. The project went to the trash history of failed icos. They are fighting for stealing a closed source code when everything must be open source. This project is not only a trash coin, but it is a fucking bad joke. Developers left, they scammed ico investors for 12 millions of dollars, pools are scamming each other, gpu mining, people are mining for free, the team manipulates the price buying coins to keep the price afloat.  In a year and a half, half of the ico money went to dust. Nothing great was created. Nimiq will go definitely go to the trash history of icos. I am thankful I sold all my bag and I am done with the shitshow.",neg
"    The project is a continuous shitshow scam. The team is being sued by Robin Linus, who is still the President of the Foundation. They initially claimed that they removed ""removed"" Robin from power due to his Cannabis Drug Abuse, but in reality they took control over power and the ICO money. Later on, we learned that they were always lying about Robin's research, and we uncover that Robin Linus became a severe cannabis drug abuser. In one year, they wasted about 5 million USD. From 12.8 USD ICO, now they own only 7-8 million USD. The burning rate is about $250,000 a month. The wages of their great developers who didn't push not even 20 commints last month is $200,000 a year without additional bonuses, travel expenses, chef, food & beverages. Most of the community left, most of the developers left and closed their apps (nimipet, philpool, nimbus, beepool, nimigames). The project is a scam and a continuous shitshow. They confirmed that they use trading bots wasting ico money to keep the price afloat buying coins from the market. The entire project is a SHITCOIN and a continuous SHITSHOW",neg

Yes it has enough money to sustain at current burn rates for another few years but the bleed on Nimiq is painful.

It wouldn’t matter in a bull market or if there was wider spread awareness but currently we have none. Anyone looked at true volume recently? It’s pretty much nothing. I don’t know what the answer is apart from holding but to survive in these market conditions you need people to dump their BTC and buy Nimiq. I unfortunately don’t see that happening.  I hate to be the guy FUDing here as the majority of this community is great, but as much as I believe in Nimiq, fundamentals don’t mean much in this market  Arambrose In recent times I have seen that the team has not had any suitable response against FUD who is active on Bitcointalk.

Sadly to say, I turn off my miners and move to another - but working solution. Bye.  @Symphonys yeah but that's not an excuse to introduce changes that would weaken the network at scale Not if Nimiq openly dreams of more widespread adoption but the chain hopping is a serious problem that needs a solution  The spam attack issues are a real concern though if Nimiq is going for mass adoption.  @Vycid No one working on NIM or in this discord cares about making a  resilient network or fair distribution, it's not worth talking about anymore.

So, for the sake of the argument, let's restrict his commits only to bitcoin core  JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO TRICK INVESTORS!  Of course I count all of Wladimir's contributions to bitcoin which include repositories like ElementsProject/lightning, vidbina/bitcoin.env, bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org, bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org, laanwj/rust-bitcoin-rpc, laanwj/rust-clightning-rpc... because all of them are relevant contributions.    You can see that Marvin had 85+31=116 commits to the core repos, Philipp was doing 175+58=233 commits, Pascal 151+149=300 commits. So all of them had more core commits then Wladimir and both Philipp and Pascal had more than Marco.  That's so pathetic.

Thus, your question already includes a lie/FUD. (2) I am not a fake account and not paid to comment on BitcoinTalk, Reddit, Telegram, Discord or any other channel used by Nimiq. I also have never heard that Nimiq team uses any fake accounts and you give no reference for this claim. Thus, your question already includes a lie/FUD.

YES OR NO. 6) They premined 2.5% to charity. Did they send the money to charity. Which charity. Please LIST and YES OR NO. 7) They premined 2.5% to FoundationX. Did you send it to the foundation? YES OR NO. *) Who administrate the charity and foundation funds. The team nimiq or WHO?  2) you ask for yes or no when it's not a yes/no question 6/7) It's not premined but vested, i.e. most of the funds can not be transferred yet and are locked on the blockchain (for up to 10 years according to their vesting schedule). *) The funds are controlled by the two foundations board (ImpactX Foundation for charity purposed and Nimiq Foundation for Nimiq purposes). I guess those foundations are properly registered non-profits in Switzerland, so there is proper oversight through authorities.   1. How much cash do they still have ? Did they buy a 1.1 million dollar in Costa Rica YES OR NO. 2. The team PREMINED 7.5% of the entire work. PREMINED = funds that were not POW mined. They PREMINED it with a simple line of code. That is what premine means. I have never heard of ImpactX Foundation. Is there a link to their website? If not why does the team avoid to tell us the foundation details like registration number, city, address, etc... The first vesting of premined funds for charity and InpactX were already received. Why did they not send the funds to ImpactX and Charity ?? DO they keep for themselves  Regarding my argument that ROBIN LINUS has left the project either to drug abuse or to exit scam. Robin last activity was slightly before launching the project. After launching the main net he never posted anything..... he just disappeared from Planet Earth . Here is a proof, his medium activity    @RobinLinus  His account did not have any kind of activity from  April 11. About 7 months ago. Did Robin Linus exit scammed the project or did he get into a drug abuse center  Quote from: coinfanatic on January 04, 2019, 08:20:21 AM I was a big fan of Nimiq but I'm getting very disappointed.  1) In Telegram I respectfully asked to clarify these questions but they blocked me. Why do you try to suppress the discussion? 2) Why is @normana answering all questions here? Looks like he has inside information. Is he a team member trying to hide his identity behind a pseudonym? 3) ""Did Robin Linus exit scammed the project or did he get into a drug abuse center?""

Something interesting to think about: If you are an ICO investor, you probably have some stack of NIM. If that's true, why are you trying to hurt the project? If you were successful, this would even further reduce the value of your NIM, so you'd be loosing money. Stupidest investor ever - or maybe not an investor at all and just lying?  LIE LIE!!!! ROBIN LINUS, THE CANNABIS DRUG ABUSER (he addmited this) IS STILL THE PRESIDENT OF NIMIQ FOUNDATION AND IN CHARGE WITH THIS SCAM.

This is due the fact, you are hired to keep the lie to get rolling day after day.  These are your comments about the disappeared of Robin from the project. It shows clearly that you don't know where Robin is and what he is doing. Definitely he is not doing any ""research"" as you are saying.   Why did you post a video that is 11 months old as a proof of Robin participation in the project? It doesn't make any sense. The only sense you make, is that there is no involvement of Robin in this project for 10-11 months.  Why would you lie? Simple. The founder exited the project, the project will become bankrupt next year with all the ICO money, and you Richy are hired to keep the community afloat a few more months.  Simple facts:  - Robin is still part of the project. - Robin has been focusing only on research for the last 6 months. Other members of the team met with him recently to analyze his research approach. - Somebody in Nimiq Telegram asked why he is not part of meetups. I shared a video of THE FIRST meetup and explained that he also didn't participate in this meetup even though he was in the next room coding. - There are 3 founders, a Team of developers and an entire community behind Nimiq. - This is all true. You can decide not to believe it, that's your own right. But it is the truth.  LIES AND LIES. CONFIRMED TO BE LIES AFTER 3-4 WEEKS.

"     THE BIGGEST LIE OF THE YEAR This is definitely the biggest lie these people said. They have banned hudrends of people on: discord, telegram, reddit and deleted youtube messages. Nimiq is one of the most censored project. People have been banned and many posted complains on Reddit and Bitcointalk that they have been banned requesting access before. Wasn't @coinfanatic banned on telegram months ago ?    From Reddit.  Quote I was personally accused of being a Robin sockpuppet by a telegram mod, for coming into the channel to support him after I read his reddit post. Before being banned I was never given the chance to prove that I wasn't Robin, which would have been trivial--I could have responded with an audio recording of my voice, which would have made it pretty darn obvious I wasn't him--I'm Australian. (Although I completly lost my cool and told one of the mods to fuck themselves as a result of the accusation which may have been the main reason I was banned).  I participated in the ICO, and expressed my concern for the uselessness of the browser miner after launch when it became clear it was a boondoggle. Like many infrequent users of telegram, I deleted my account. I have always had a foot in the webdollar camp as well as the nimiq camp and am critical of both (and so was also accused of being a webdollar shill). Also my account creation was before any of this Robin drama kicked off [but I suppose you'd say that Robin was creating sockpuppets in preparation for the drama].  All this demonstrates is the community is paranoid enough to be so sure that Robin sockpuppeting as to accuse a random users of being him. I never made any personal attacks on Philip or Elion. I demanded to know how much Richy was being paid, and he refused to answer. I can't even remember which mod I told to ""fuck you"" after the accusation.  All of this says a lot about the honesty with which the team are going to answer any of these AMA questions, of which Robin was the catalyst.   Quote 1 month ago Hi u/btrs_88,  I feel sorry that you had a bad experience in our community. The telegram mods have a hard time with a lot of people only joining to watch and deepen the drama. Especially from the BitcoinTalk community, a lot of FUDers joined the community channels. However, please note that the Telegram moderators are not part of the Nimiq Team and only tried to protect the team and the community. Calling them bad words certainly doesn't help in such situations. I guess you can ask mods to unban your account in a friendly way, soon. Most of the drama will probably be over after the AmA, so mods can get back to the usual approach.  This situation is extraordinary for all of us, so please pardon those that didn't handle it perfectly. There, unfortunately, are no instructions how to handle such things.  They ban the shit out of people. Probably their moderators and the team banned hudrends of people who asked legit questions about their structure and organisation. Even now we don't have an official statement describing the Nimiq Foundation members. Who is President? Is Robin Linus the President (of course, but they don't want to disclose this)  The project is a bad joke and a scam. Sweep all their dirt under the carpet.  They always lie. Now they tell us: ""we never banned people"". Screw you. I have been personally banned on Telegram and Reddit! Many other ICO investors had been banned as well on Telegram by Richy, you and other moderators. JUST BE FRANK AND ADMIT THE TRUTH",neg
"   The project is a scam. Just move on. I already moved on. I sold all my NIM coins and now I am into looking on great projects with high potential. I am talking about GRIN and BEAM.

   yes yes nimiq is a SCAM. web mining is not worth it. it is like 10x less performant than terminal mining using specialized software. now cpu mining is worthless while gpu mining is ok. project is a scam. they did 12.9 million dollar ico. now they are milking cash cow. rest is shitshow,neg
open source my ass. project is uterrly centralized by 2 developers ( philipp and pascal). So much that they removed their own boss who is still in charge thoretically. some rumors are saying that they killed robin linus to take all ico money. they habe the money and decide everything. smart people understand this and are complaining about the shady operations and organisation.,neg
"Nimiq's secret agenda unveiled  Nimiq's secret plot is simply to launder the ICO millions by paying themselves excessive salaries and benefits. Nimiq will go bankrupt in 11 to 13 months and then trapped investors will have nothing but worthless tokens.  To manipulate investors nimiq uses fake accounts such as ""normana"". They try to act trustworthy to spread lies but they are dishonest and highly manipulative. They are censoring proven facts and try to eliminate any critical thinking. ""Normana"" tries to discredit everyone who speaks up against Nimiq's hidden agenda.  There is overwhelming evidence that these malicious accounts are run by Marvin Wissfeld. Even the former CEO of Nimiq confirmed that Marvin is hiding behind these malicious fake identities. For his manipulative activities Marvin is paid about $200000 per year. He is working only one day a week. Most of the week he is busy with his pet projects.  Nimiq's price and volume is manipulated by trading bots. They desperately try to keep their token afloat until they've burned all their ICO money. They will continue until they've completed their shady exit scam.    TL;DR: NORMANA IS A MANIPULATIVE FAKE ACCOUNT. NIMIQ PRICE IS MANIPULATED BY TRADING BOTS",neg
                                           I can confirm your findings @coinfanatic. I am deeply sorry to see that their sole purpose of nimiq team was to scam ICO investors. At the moment they are doing everything to keep the scam from going on enabling them to milk their ICO cash cow. This is how Ponzi schemes are managed and most of them get busted only in recessions. Nimiq will get bankrupt in the next 6-12 months.  I have lost a lot of money investing in this scam coin. All my ICO investments from tens of thousands of dollars are worth just a couple of bucks now. I don't even think about how many people became homeless by buying this scam coin. There is even one person that goes by username yuluxugi32132 who reported blew his brains due to tremendous loses with nimiq scam coin.,neg
"the project is an ICO scam. they raised tons of money and how they are just ""burning"" all that money to look legit for SEC. no utility, no progress for the last months. project is dead. fight in the team. robin linus (founder and CEO) of nimiq is a cannabis drug addict. project goes nowhere. digging not profitable. really bad bad",neg
"                                        WARNING: Nimiq spreads malware!

You should be ashamed of yourself. Quite frankly this kind of behaviour makes me want to block everything related to your nimiq network."" (Source: Github)",neg
nimiq is an ico scam. their only interest was to get ico money and then to cash in. the project burned over 7 million dollars in one year and a half with no real traction or progress. they have only 6 million left at the moment. next year will shutdown and call of bankruptcy. the project is dead for good,neg
  Guess that this should read everyone who are going to put some money in this project. Let's fight with scammers together.,neg
   yes yes. we need to fight against these scammers. all ico investors lost everything. they started mining with gpu video cards. the coin is dead. CEO Robin Linus admitted that he consumes cannabis and couldn't work for the project so the team exit scam robin linus removing him from the project's funds. everything is going downfall. the project is a complete failure and bankruptcy is imminent.  @saminer read rippar message. stupid nimiq miner. you are dumping all coins you mine everyday.,neg
   Here facts why Nimiq is a SCAM. They always use sockpuppet accounts like Marvin Wissfeld's account (normana) impersonating fake identities to make the project look legit.,neg
"SCAM ALERT!!!!  NIMIQ TEAM DID NOT BUILD THE NIMIQ CAMPUS. THEY JUST STOLE THE ICO MONEY INSTEAD OF BUILDING THE NIMIQ CAMPUS. WHAT IS THE ADDRESS OF NIMIQ CAMPUS. ANY PHOTO, ANY VIDEO WITH THE NIMIQ CAMPUS??? WHERE IS IT??? NO WHERE  They were just lying all this time",neg
                It is a disastrous ICO.  I was thinking that this shit coin will end up like this. I regret investing in their ICO SCAM! I just want an ICO refund. If not 1:1 at least half of the initial price. The project is going to the trash bin like somebody commented here before.  NIMIQ = SCAMIQ an ICO scam,neg
    You are a fake person impersonating a fake name. Most probably you are Philipp. You are full of shit. There was no KYC or restriction for millions of Americans who got trapped buying your trash coin. The IP validation did not exist for all ips and there was no KYC. I am sure SEC will bust your asses and you will end up in jail.,neg
"Nimiq's Tech Lead Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky is a drug addict.  In this video you can see a huge bag of drugs on his desk. Philipp's girlfriend tries to hide the drugs but actually holds them right into the camera. (Watch the video in HD and 0.25 speed to see more details.) I am not sure if there is only cannabis on the table. Maybe the other small bag is cocaine.     The user ""nimiqshitcoin"" was right and another lie of nimiq got debunked. Nimiq is one of the most shady shitcoin projects I've ever seen.",neg
"     I didn't spot everything. I don't watch every shitshow video they upload because my time is precious I told you! I warned you a few months ago about this scam team and their shady organization. Everything is hidden and they always hide everything from investors. Hurensohn posted a link with a  proof that shows clearly that they have been always lying and they consume together cannabis and probably they take cocaine as well. Robin Linus was removed from the project because he became too addicted to cannabis and he can't mentally work anymore. Philipp will be the next who will get brain wasted by drugs. This is why his stupid wife is always with him to stop him from getting stoned.      PROOF THAT THEY HAVE A BAG FULL OF CANNABIS, A MARIJUANA GREENDER AND OCB CIGARETTE ROLLING PAPERS.           IF YOU STILL DON'T BELIEVE ME THAT THEY ARE DRUG ADDICTS, THEN THIS IS EXACTLY HOW STONED PEOPLE LOOK LIKE   ",neg
    yes yes. robin linus admitted that they smoke cannabis in costa rica. he admited that the entire team is addicted to cannabis drugs. project is dead. stupid crackheads,neg
"   You are a fake person impersonating a fake name as well. I have no idea what this sentence should mean, but we both use nicknames so it must be true for you as well.  Your KYC/US restrictions statement is completely wrong. 1. There was a strong US restriction during the ICO. I was in the US during the ICO, so I know for sure it was the case. But I also found proof for it: You can see in the backup of archive.org on this page that clicking the ""Contribute"" button on the ICO website will link you to the URL -sale/country-check (which isn't stored on archive.org). Country check already looks like the URL for a country check, but of course that alone is not a proof that this is indeed a US restrictions. Luckily I found two screenshots on the internet confirming this. This is the site that you see when accessing the website outside the US. This is the site you see when accessing the website from within the US or Puerto Rico. Additionally, you can see in the terms that it was forbidding to participate for US people. tl;dr: There was no way around the US restriction without using a VPN and intentional lying before participation. Any American that did that should be aware of the fact that he or she is not protected by US laws. 2. There was a KYC during the activation of the mainnet token NIM. All NET owners were required to do KYC to get their NIM.",neg
"   cannabis proof yes! that is cannabis! drugs 100% pure. cheap also in costa rica! video is from 1-2 months ago! robin left costa rica 6 months ago. organisation is shady! you always lying when we said that the ENTIRE team smoke cannabis. that bag is not only for one person but for multiple people! shut up! fake person. you impersonate fake name. you tried to deceive people by going under fake name: ""Norman Albsander"". fake  fake. team nimiq is addicted to drug. they hide it. they smoke and not work. project is fucked up as you philipp",neg
I have been miles away from this project but dude leave people as they are you don't like just move ON. Even if they are using those drugs you cannot do anything at all. They already have millions on there pocket and you cannot do anything at all actually I wanted to use nasty word but again it's not good to use those words in public.,neg
"   I am one of the stupid ICO investors who gave them $50,000+ to what? To buy drugs and waste their time smoking cannabis? Take your shit and move somewhere else! I want SEC to make these scammers pay! They use fake accounts like Normana to deceive other investors while they continue smoking pot and buy 1.1 million dollar villas",neg
"  Everybody knows you are lying about the villa. The team provided extensive material to debunk the myth and you must have seen that, which means you are intentionally lying. So why should we expect you to say the truth about anything else in the same paragraph? If you want us to believe the story that you are highly invested into Nimiq, give us a proof or shut it up.

I have always said that they consume drugs (including cannabis) and yesterday I have uploaded the ultimate proof from their own videos that they use drugs in Costa Rica.  We are the people who got scammed by these scammers.

"   yes yes. it is hilarious. they don't even know what lies should they write next. robin linus came with the idea of implementing rust client, they ""kicked"" robin from the project and now they said rust implementation was a great idea. the reality is that literally, except 5000 developers worldwide nobody else is using this rust language.",neg

   Here are the facts: Normana is a fake account of Marvin Wissfeld.

The only difference is that average crypto guy after will get scammed by nimiq will leave the community, while only a handful of people start reporting their shady practices on bitcointalk. This is the reason why most of the community left already the project and only sockpuppet accounts and paid community members are involved in the project anymore.",neg
I HAVE A NEW PROOF OF PRICE MANIPULATION. THE TEAM SCAMIQ IS BUYING COINS FROM THE MARKET TO KEEP THE PRICE OF THE SCAM AFLOAT.       1. THEY NEVER TOUCHED THE VESTING ACCOUNTS ALTHOUGH THEY PAID COMMUNITY OVER 10 MILLION NIMS TO COMMUNITY FUNDING BOARD PROPOSALS #2  AND OVER 30 MILLION NIMS TO COMMUNITY FUNDING BOARD PROPOSALS  #3 . THIS MEANS THEY HAD NIMS FROM A DIFFERENCE SOURCE. EITHER MINING OR FROM BUYING COINS FROM THE MARKET. IT IS CLEARLY THAT THEY HAVE ACQUIRED HUNDRENDS OF MILLIONS OF NIMS FROM THE MARKET WITH THE ICO MONEY TO MAKE THE PRICE TO BE AFLOAT      2. ROBIN LINUS (FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF FOUNDATION NIMIQ) ACCUSED THE REST OF THE TEAM THAT THEY MANIPULATE THE PRICE USING TRADING BOTS       3.

Probably at the end of this year, nimiq will have 3 million dollars and finally realize that the project is DEAD and can't survive in the business world. The project burned already 6 million dollars from 12.7 million, and this year alone will burn at least 5 million until in December.  Btw. They are also planning to switch to proof of stake leaving all miners broke and not being able to mine any new coin with their CPU and GPU equipment. No more browser mining at all. After they switch to proof of stake, everybody will leave: sushi guys, miners, pools will get closed as well, vj1977, the Vietnamese guys, hundreds of miners with free vps.

They live in their 1.1 million dollar villa bubble with money, chef, sushi, weed, and surfing every morning.

"They are just going to fuck every miner, every developer, every holder. They just want to create a new blockchain which is UTXO (like Robin Linus) from scratch, with a new Genesis, switching the POW to completely ( 100% ) POS with a stupid and centralized consensus algorithm that doesn't add any new value to the consensus algorithm.  Speed is not resolved by reducing the block time, but by something else.  Most probably this albatrous algorithm will be developed only in RUST and browser compatibility will be done only through RPC centralized systems. They even wrote that the light nodes need to be recompiled every time to give the last macroblock via the javascript bundle. Thus the light consensus is achieved only through hard-coded software centralization because they change the macroblock every time you refresh the web page and the last macroblock will be written in your javascript bundle. To make myself crystal clear, a full node hosted by the team is changing the hosted javascript bundle with the last macroblock, and in case you refresh the webpage you will receive the last macroblock being hardcoded in the js bundle.  Also, Pools will never be able to be achieved on this abatrus system.",neg

We all know that ICOs never do what they say in their whitepaper, so Nimiq trying to do so should be a big red flag! They created a new fake research paper proposing a fake innovative protocol, but in reality PoS is nothing new at all, so OBVIOUSLY no innovation here. Also they say(*) with their new protocol they will airdrop to Bitcoin Cash holders only and will restart the chain at the beginning of every month removing all balances.

So in Albatros it's actually not 51%, but 34%, because the security assumption is that at most one third (of selected block producers) is Byzantine. Haven't heard that, can you provide a proof that 51% is 34%? There is no 51% attack, that's just a stupid saying from PoW chains. What usually is meant by 51% attack is double-spend attack or selfish mining attacks. For those attacks, attackers on PoW chains need about 51% of mining power (well, you can do with less than 51%, but then you need luck). As far as I understood, PBFT needs 67% for double-spend, no? And selfish mining is not an issue in Albatross as there is no mining at all. From what I understood, the thing you can do with 34% in PBFT is to halt the protocol. This attack will cause your 34% stake to become worth nothing and can be resolved by all other stakers through a collaborative fork. So the effect is limited and you don't earn anything from it (= no incentive to perform), definitely not comparable to a 51% attack on PoW chains.    stupid marvin suckpuppet  Quote  SoerenLast Wednesday at 11:58 AM In Albatros it's actually not 51%, but 34%, because the security assumption is that at most one third (of selected block producers) is Byzantine.   abatros is vulnerable to 33% to get hacked for good.

So, Agora Trade (with 0 users) + Weg Bank (Which will be renamed to Agora Bank with 0 users) will do a BRAND NEW ICO selling Agora trash coins to stupid investors (like the ones who bought your nimiq shitcoin ) or your personal SCAM Solidified which was another ICO done by YOU and a few of your fellas just months ago in 2018.  You guys are full of shit!  Nimiq ICO - 2017 Solidified ICO - 2018 - created by a few nimiq developers including YOU! Agora Trade ICO - 2019 - brand new ICO is coming soon  every year, nimiq developers and partners launch a new ICO  You are banning every person on telegram. Everybody got banned on your channels. You remove messages on Reddit and also on Youtube. I have seen dozens of messages that were afterward removed from youtube as well. You are one of the most censorship projects.",neg
"    If you didn't know about the ICO that Agora Trade and WEG bank will be holding then you shouldn't have discussing BS on bitcointalk. Simple as that. Please kindly Julian, move on on your shitty ICO project and work there instead of writing false information here telling us: ""I didn't know about this. Sorry"". It is more than obvious that all of you are doing ICOs only to collect funds. Nimiq, Solidified, Agora Trade, and maybe soon TreeCoin made by Robin Linus. Not only your ICO, Solidified was a total failure, but nimiq ICO is a disastrous ICO as well, as my initial investment would have been -96.3% now. Thankfully, I sold it a few months ago and I got rid of this scam.",neg
What a motherfucking shitshow.,neg
"   yes. shitshow full of ico scams. miners dig unprofitable. they manipulate price, they control software. some people dig with gpu since launch. nimiq developers had different icos which were total failures. agora trade ico will be held soon. so, prepare your pocket for a new ico.",neg

Next shitcoin and useless project by agora trade? Twitter is yelling hard around their social media accounts..,neg
"    Yup. Prepare your pocket money to handle it the ""agora"" trade project which has 0 customers and 0 users. The partnership is so strong with nimiq that even after 8 months, nimiq is not allowed to be exchanged on their magic platform. Oh, wait is their shit working or not? So, prepare your money for the argora trade ICO",neg

Nimiq is a stupid scamcoin,neg
   yes yes. this is what they say. they say that nimiq ICO paid Arthur Gervais tuition because he didn't receive one from the college. really bad,neg
"Recently, I didn't have time for this scam anymore. We lost money with nimiq's scam ICO. We just need to admit that we were the stupid ones who handled them our money and they were the smart ones who took it. The only thing that makes me angry is to see that they try to do another ICO with agora trade. I am really disappointed to see that the scam repeats itself. Personally, it looks like Robin Linus exit scammed the project as they are just post some useless news from time to time to look legit, while their founder just exit scammed the project. This is how it looks.",neg
Team Nimiq works only for about 2 days a month,neg
"     Very well said. They only burn > $250,000 a month with literally no REAL results. It is clear that they are just laundering ICO money to look legit. They aren't doing shit in Costa Rica except smoking cannabis.",neg
   yes yes. it is clear that nimiq is just laundering ico money to look legit. in 12 months they will shut down the entire operations in costa rica. it is confirmed that robin linus exit scam the project. this is why (president of nimiq and founder of nimiq) is silent for more than 3 months. exit scam with millions of dollars from ico money.,neg

No-one is buying this shitcoin,neg
"   Indeed. They have admitted already that every month, they are buying nims from the market worth 50,000 USD. Mostly, they are the ones who are buying these coins. The foundation itself using the ICO money. It is simple as that. Raise funds selling net at 1.5 USD and buy nims at 0,0001 usd. Really good investment for the developers and the scammers. I do believe also that the entire store with Robin Linus was to exit scam the project.",neg
"   this is so bad for a coin to have over 250,000 usd burning rate per month will undoubtedly assure bankruptcy... it looks really ugly",neg
"   Good finding guys !!! I didn't know that the guy from Tinkler also had a different ICO project before working on this Melon Coin. Indeed, it looks like all these people agora.trade, nimiq, weg bank are only making money by doing ICOs cashing in millions of dollars from investors who are wasting their money. They always make useless projects, with no real customers and all their projects are just P&D marketing stunts to cash in once BIG TIMES. I am just waiting for the next financial report that will reveal that nimiq team is having financial problems with a total financial budget of less than 4 million dollars. Just waiting to see that report (hopefully they will publish it). My insider source told me that nimiq team is having a fight inside the team as they are clueless with the project. Moreover, they are buying coins from time to time to increase the price artificially.",neg
"   It is clear that they started to pump their own shitcoin. They buy their own coin deceiving people to believe anybody is buying it. But, the reality is that NOBODY is buying this shitcoin. There are no other real users. On telegram and discord, same 10 people make 95% of the messages.... this is the definition of a scam. Pumping and price manipulation to trick users buying it. Penny stock scam.",neg
"I HAVE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING INTERNAL INFORMATION WHO WANTS TO BE ANONYMOUS.  Nimiq signed a deal with WAG Bank to PAY 1 MILLION DOLLAR FOR 9.9% OF WEG Bank with an evaluation of a ""bank"" of only 10 million dollars. But the deal is not in Fiat or Eth or BTC. The deal was in Nimiq. Because team nimiq didn't own enough coins just 10% of the 1 million USD deal in nimiq, they started buying coins from the market on HitBTC. The entire pump is caused only by NIMIQ / WEG BANK buying over ~ 1 billion coins from the market. This is the sure way to lose money: buy your own coin buying high and selling low.",neg
"   Prick. You made me post the email I have got    My source claims that they are the ones who are buying the coin. Namely, they bought coins worth 1 million usd to pay for 10% of WEG Bank. So, they are pumping their own coin.",neg
"   yes yes. nimiq is shady. they invested 1 million dollar pumping the market to buy 9.9% of weg shady bank, while lite coin foundation received it for free. am i the only one who wants to how much liquidity does nimiq have? 2-3 million usd?",neg
"   IMHO. Besides the fact that nimiq is turning into a shady ICO exactly like TokenPay which is always lying and deceiving people (even scamming bounty hunters for millions of dollars ), I believe that the entire buyout of 9.9% of WEG Bank (which doesn't have 1 customer and 1 working product/service) it have cost them more than 1 million dollar. It could have cost them at least 2.5 million dollars making the scam ""bank"" evaluation for 25 million dollars. I am just curious if Richy or others will disclose the figure number to know how much they waisted buying 9.9% of nothing.",neg
   Wow. This smells so much like market manipulation bullshit. Also possible insider trading. I wonder how high they will try to pump their shitcoin.,neg
"    Facts proved about price manipulation  1. Trading Bot was proven by bitcointalk and confirmed after Robin Linus asked them publicly to tell to the community if they run trading bots, and they said YES  2. They confirmed that they acquired coins from the market to pay community projects. Btw here are the community projects? Does any of them work? Is one working? Is any of them used by anybody  3. They confirmed that every month they acquire coins worth $35,000 to pay for developers.  4. They acquired 9.9% of WEG Bank. So they invested over 1 million dollar buying coins from the market  5. They announced that the WEG Bank acquisition is under NDA. Although we know that they acquired 9.9% for 1 million dollar investment, they don't want to tell us.",neg
    yes yes. RED FLAGS every were. project got deals with tokenpay (another proven scam that scammed bounty hunters for over 1 million dollar). did you know there is an entire thread about how tokenpay scammed hundrends of bounty hunters on bitcointalk. the shady business nimiq is doing it is just proving that robin linus was right when he said that the project was hijacked and turned into a scam. this is exactly what they do every day. they just want to scam other investors buying their worthless coin. now they want to scam even miners turning the coin into 100% pos explaining us that pow albatross can't be done. the project is a shit hole and a scam in the same time. bad bad project to scam people investing into icos.,neg
"   This shit is getting really serious about the scam nimiq is doing. From what I see on bitcointalk nimiq found its only partnership two companies with really shady history and background.  1. Agora trade which is solely focused is to do an ICO. They don't have anything else in mind, just pushing their agenda with ICO and raise funds from other people scamming them investing into another worthless crypto project.  2. WEG Bank - which is a god damn shady bank with no products, no service and of course no customers. Just remember that WEG Bank partnered up with TokenPay another well known ICO scam which got over 20 million in funding promising things that they have never delivered. They just uploaded a fork of POSv3 with nothing else. The explorer is not showing any anonymous transaction, etc. They also promise something that doesn't exist.  The shit is going nuts now. Don't forget Robin Linus which clearly started that nimiq was turned into a scam by his colleagues. This behavior makes me believe that they are just milking the ico for their own profits.",neg
"These guys are pathetic liars! They never answer anything, they just keep lying and their miners come from time to time on bitcointalk to shit their coin. They never explained what is the deal with Weg Bank about. Why does the bank suddenly decided to switch its name to ""Agora bank"". Are they looking to join the Agora bank ICO? Most probably this will happen, and oh boy, I just wait the time to gain exposure to the agora new ico investors.  They just consider everybody to be a fudder if that person brings them questions or ask them some information. They always say: ""the Agora Bank investment is signed under NDA - we can't discuss it"". You call this transparency? No, this is a fucking centralized and shady company. I am very sure that until the end of this year their financial no longer look so great and maybe we will see the first people who resign or are fired to reduce the burning rate. Soon or later, we may see Richy jobless.",neg
"   Having a burning rate of over 300,000 USD a month (including WEG Bank acquisition of 1 million usd, travel, etc), this shitcoin will last only for 1 more year. It is clear to anybody that they are just interested to exit scam the project.",neg
"   Simple because the price is totally fake! They bought their own coins to raise the price artificially. Just after they signed the NDA deal with WEG Bank worth for at least 1 million dollars, the price went straight up. Simple as that.",neg
"yea big news with no utility. nobody is gonna use these updates. shit coin. they are just laundering the ico money. having 250,000 USD per month burning rate is looking great",neg
"   Relax man, accept this scam for what it is. Trade if you want to make money, that's all this shitcoin is good for now.",neg
   Interesting finding. Maybe they should make a video explaining to us how they spend the ICO money buying cannabis and OCBs to smoke pot.,neg
    sure sure. keep barking. you will get fucked when they switch to full pos. guaranteed that pos will fuck all pow miners including you saminer... keep barking. maybe they will get bankrupt before launching the pos ,neg
"   i did not invest into ico, but i have mined. initially i mined in browser, then i acquired xeon servers mining in sushi pool. 2 monthg ago i got fucked up when they released gpu mining. i sold most of my coins because of the project failure. i don't care about the price anymore as i hold very little coins. i did lost some money buying the xeon server mining the ""cpu only nimiq coin"" which turned out to be gpu friendly. maybe you should let this thread to be discussed by the people who had experience mining coins, buying coins and those are hodling this shitcoin. i just want transparency but i do see that the project it is very dark. they never explained us about the robin linus's drug abuse problem. i see that they are hiding everytyhing in costa rica playing as dumb that they never kenw all this. it is clear to everybody that the ico is a total failure and the project will eventully die due to bankruptcy. maybe next time you should listen to what people involved into this coin believe. thx",neg
"ya its bad complete lack of progress, not even a GUI wallet yet i have mined Nimiq for like a year +,  nothing but shit exchanges opened up for it, they couldnt get team support so closed just another cash grab : /",neg
    they never admit this. simply. the team is interesting only to milk the ico money. this is why robin linus accused them of running a scam and kick him out from the team. simple as that. the project turned into a scam. simple as that.  when community projects? when new exchanges? when pos ? when weg bank? when agora trade dex ? when gui wallet ? when transparency report ? when new key guard ( q4 2018) ? when wordpress integration (q4 2018) ? when weg bank service of internet banking ? when software updates?  nothing so far. only one pdf paper with an idea. project is dead already.,neg
"    Bro, they never want to admit this. They always scream that we fud them, while the project is more than dead. Sooner or later the truth will come out.  It will come either from them or from people who know them. The shit is about to explode. It is just a matter of time until this failed project will explode. Maybe Robin Linus, should talk to us explaining how they hijacked the project from him.",neg
    yes yes. nimiq = token pay = weg bank = agora trade = scams for icos. project dead is. they fail everyday,neg
   yeah sure. Did they finish the Q4 2018 key guard and Q4 2018 wordpress integration? Did they finish the Q2 2018 Cash Link ? The project was turned into a complete scam milking the ICO money.,neg

Phillipp  Pascal Berrang  Marvin Wissfeld   They didn't write one line of code in the last month! Get serious. The project is fucking DEAD!  My reason why I so upset on nimiq is that I have lost a tremendous amount of money. FYI: over $100,000 in total.",neg

So your entire complain is: ""I started mining and bought mining equipment. Then community developers implemented a GPU miner and I didn't like that""  1- Aren't community developers implementing GPU miners a demonstration of interest from skilled developers and an obvious proof of the community supporting Nimiq? 2- Where did you get that Nimiq is a ""cpu only coin""?  YOU! everybody including you was talking that nimiq is a browser minable coin. it means it was CPU only coin. making it profitable to mine in the browser. then skypool came out and people started using their cli software to mine with xeon servers. after a few more months, sushi pool released gpu mining which makes your browser mining cpu only feature totally useless.",neg
the project is fucking dead. No github activity on the main code. The important developers didn't write any new code. They are just wasting the ico money surfing in costa rica. They even stopped filming themselves surfing. Why not film your all activities ? Including smoking cannabis ? ,neg

He is still the president of the Nimiq Foundation making him the boss of the foundation and the one who is signing your 10,000 dollars a month salary. You are exactly the definition of a cockroach. You don't respect him only because somebody from your team wrote a medium article saying that he was excluded from the project, yet he is still your CEO and president of the Nimiq foundation.",neg
   Lol. Robin Linux. They have even forgotten what his real surname is. What a Fucking shitshow.,neg
    Yeah sure. They forgot their own CEO's name. He is still the president of the Nimiq Foundation and Nimiq Charity. No doubt that Robin Linus accused them for running a scam. I don't understand how could Robin Linus keep silence for so long now. I guess he received a big check to shut up... They even removed his messages from Reddit. Scam proved.,neg

Why top 3 Developers who are paid with over 100,000 USD per year didn't work in the last 3 months. I am saying: Philipp, Pascal, Marvin. 5. Price manipulation and trading bots. Before Robin officially asked them, they always lied telling us: ""NO"". After Robin Linus asked them, they answered yes without any details.",neg

"   Like 2000 other ICO investors, I have lost 96% of my investment into nimiq. The only thing I see from them are these:  - President of Nimiq was a cannabis drug abuser - A user on bitcointalk published proofs showing them in a youtube video with bag full of weed, OCBs and grinder. - Their latest news is that they sponsorship with the ICO money a summer school. They stopped delivering after main net. When Cash Links, when Wordpress integration, when Q4 2019 ? They didn't even want to mention a new road map as they STOPPED delivering their work. - They failed to update the software and release upgrades from Q4 2018. The new keyguard and new UX which were planned to be released in Q4 2018 were never released. Now, we are in Q2 2019. - They are burning over $250,000 a month ( the figure was provided by them) although I couldn't see any outputs from the top developers( MArvin, Philipp, Pascal didn't write a line of code in the last 3 months). - I want transparency from a project that has shady ties with TokenPay and a paper-based bank in Germany. - They failed to deliver marketing, software upgrades, keep track on their milestones, etc. - They said they removed  Robin Linus from the project, although, right now as we are speaking (after 3 months from the process), HE IS STILL THE PRESIDENT of the nimiq foundation.",neg
"   I understand your points of view. You are right. I have lost money and I need to move on with my life. In many ways, I already moved on. My company is doing well. I already sold most of the coins I've got from the ICO and later on. I am not interested in accepting WEG Bank bribe to shut up. Didn't you notice that ""Robin Linux"" suddenly closed his mouth? Most probably they bribed him as well, just like the WEG bank was trying to bribe me with their offer ""Free ticket to Germany and nights at a luxurious resort"". I am not interested in getting in return a 1000 euro premium touristic package when I lost over $100,000+ ....",neg
     How I lost money investing in nimiq? SIMPLE! I bought Nimiq Exchange Tokens during the ICO and later on NET. I did the KYC and swap my NET into NIM. The NIM coins I got from the ICO are worth with -95% less in value. . Yeah! I am one of these stupid investors who bought their stupid coin during the ICO. Please shut the fuck up if you don't know about this project. Move on a different topic instead of spamming this thread with nonsense.,neg
"   Why are you so stupid I don't know. First of all, that is NOT My Account. Probably it was a fake account made by one of webd shit coin community. I DON'T CARE about JSE Coin, WebDollar, WebChain, Lisk or any other javascript based project. I didn't invest into these shitcoins. I only believed nimiq was one of these honest projects and just a shitcoin like JSECoin, Webd, WebChain or any other fork or shit project. I care only about nimiq because I have lost a tremendous amount of money investing in their ""GRAND VISION"" while they just surf, smoke weed and do nothing in Costa Rica! That is the reality.  Most probably, you are just a miner who is mining and dumping their coin to stupid investors or to the foundation directly, as we all know that they manipulate the price buying coins. Where did they get he 3.3 million new coins to pay for the Chinese exchange? As I don't see any movement from their charity and foundation unlocked accounts.",neg
   Lol you sure about that buddy? Sounds like your a bagholder. I sold out all my coin at the low so I don't care. But to me looks like it gonna go back to the fucking ground where it started. 'Cos there is no visible progress on the core from team Scumiq. There is not enough exciting news & progress for investors new and old to get excited about. Result is a sagging coin price.,neg
"   Don't even bother talking to that guy. He is not a nimiq holder, he never hodl any tokens (NET) or coins (NIM). He was asking me to stop using red big font, while he is using red font as well to debunk other projects as well.  The project is indeed DEAD. No software updates, no upgrades, no vision behind, no road map, no price movement (it was only artificial price manipulation done by them).  BTW: I like the name scumiq. good name.",neg

The community forum was launched as far as I remember back in December, not a few weeks ago, but a couple of months ago. That is not a news, it just an fucking joke.",neg
"   Yes. I was an ICO investor and was dumb enough to hold to the mainnet. Nobody expected this coin to have no marketing, no good exchanges. That was what the ICO money is for, but they like to have it in their own pockets more. To be honest what can you expect from these guys they are a bunch of kids with no management kicking their ass. I also notice their performance gets worse month by month, that's what the drugs is doing to their brains. Wasted.",neg
"   i am exactly in the same boat as you. I was even greedier. I bought NET tokens during the ICO, then I decided to buy more in Oct 2017 because the communicated to us that main net will be launched by end of 2017. Then after the main net, I bought directly NIM coins from Trade Satoshi. Everything went so low with this shit coin. So, I decided to sell after some time, when I realized that these scumbags are doing literally nothing with the ICO money. They just pocketed the ICO money while filming themselves in Costa Rica smoking pot. Worst possible experience for me.",neg

The price is clearly manipulated by using their ICO money. They set the price and a handful of POW miners are happy doing the coins to the market. There is literally no future for the project.

Claiming false and fake information about my account associating me with others. 2. Trying (not successfully) to leak my privacy tracking me online in order to attack me personally.

really really untrustworthy nimiq is. these people never learn to respect community. people are really mad on them for not delivering anything. what did you deliver this year. nothing. 99% of community left already. most are full of anger against nimiq. i don't even want to imagine the ico investors... who lost everything. i am also anger against nimiq now. but i see that they make lies about community members and bitcointalk.  who are us ? the bitcointalkers fudders  miners - yes yes a lot of us ico investors traders holders,neg

   sure sure. conspiracy theories. usually europeans believe chinese people are aliens. believe me or not. they didn't release any significant update since end of last year. nothing was done. only videos uploaded on youtube talking about new things which were never delivered and put it in practice. most of the accounts nimiq shillers on bitcointalk are sockpuppet accounts. even robin linus accused the team of using sock puppet accounts to shill their project and coin.,neg

I started smoking pot and I ended up being a junkie myself. I consumed heroin and that period was one of the darkest days of my life. I regret it totally. After 1 and half year of consuming heroin, my sister helped me out to get rid of this toxic life. I know what drugs are, and I am 100% against them. 2. Now, I no longer have junkies as friends because drugs kills the shit out of you. 3 & 4. Either you are stupid or you smoke too much.

   No one is going to invest a dime into this shitcoin.  ,neg
   Actually the project has done a lot of wrongdoing. Such as overly inflated compensation to team members (mostly the core backend guys) for doing very little work. And no money invested in spreading awareness and adoption of the coin. Which is why this is a scam project. No one wants to buy into a coin which is not used by anyone. The ICO was a misselling of grotesque proportions.,neg

Being now an anti-drugs guy, I really hate to see that these people got addicted to drugs once they got a lot of money from the ICO.",neg

Remember the movie The Wolf of Wall Street or Scarface...",neg
"  Based on that thread Nimiq seems to have paid $500k (~5% of funds?) to HITBTC, a known unusable and scammy exchange by everyone that ever used crypto. They purchased part of a bank for an undisclosed amount. Acquired property in Costa Rica for $1million which seems illiquid and not a wise investment considering you believe (do you?) in the future of money  My questions are:  When can we expect the next ""transparency"" report?  What happened to the unclaimed erc20 tokens fund?  Why is Nimiq investing in a bank?  Why does Nimiq still employs an inexperienced community manager as the ""face""? he failed in the 1.5 years he's been in charge, there are about 40 active people in the Nimiq community, most of them can't wait to make their money back to get out (thus why they are waiting impatiently for ""Binance"", as if this was a solution), the other 20 are not developing much, the few that do are doing it because they are ""paid by the community fund"" a few thousand.",neg
Why nimiq go to scam? Tell me please I checked at coinmarketcap nimiq rank is 459 Hope team make some announcement to move price go up again.,neg
"   Not only that the transparency reports fails to show any proof that they have the funds they claim. We should be able to somehow track and confirm the claimed remaining funds. Either post BTC and ETH addresses of their wallets or to pay a third party company which can conduct a propert audit and sign the audit. I, personally don't have any trust in their so called ""Transparency reports"".  They pushed the killswitch to suspend the trading activities of the NET ERC20 token. When, nimiq foundation will get bankrupt (so far they burned over 8 million dollar from their initial 12 million dollar ICO), they will most likely write a medium post saying: ""we are sorry, nobody is buying the nimiq coin. So, we have to press the killswitch suspending the nimiq network as we became bankrupt"". Remember, they stated that the burning rate of the nimiq was over 250,000 A MONTH. After some time, they mentioned the cut off some of their burning rate, but most probably the burning rate increased as well, as they hired a bunch (over 5 ) new people.

Simple answer. Cuz nimiq is a scam as well. They do everything to be in control manipulating the price buying coins from the market. Listing themselves on big exchanges, means that they will have to manipulate the price on other exchanges as well, increasing their burning rate dramatically as they would have to deploy trading bots and  buy more coins from more exchanges as well. If miners will sell all their coins now, they will become bankrupt in a day.",neg

   Nimiq is a total ICO failure which scammed investors for about 12 million dollars. Nimiq doesn't have any purpose at the moment and nobody is using it except pure speculation. Its own purpose is solely by few miners who are dumping their new generated coins to stupid buyers. These miners are also shillers to dump their coins asap.,neg

The beauty of this shitcoin is that they can install at any time a honeypot js script to sniff all private keys and crack them in a few minutes as the password is really weak ( 6 letter ) by default.

"     Yeah sure. It takes 5 minutes to do a full vanity search of 140,026,320 taking into considerations all possible colors and body parts. So, any ""hacker"" can generate an identical (identical!!!) identicon in a few minutes.  On bitcoin, a Core i7-4702MQ 2.2GHz (very old cpu), it scan (CPU only) 1.10 mkey/s.

A hacker if he knows the original address/identicon  he can generate an identical (100% identical fake address) in less than 2 minutes (number proved above). Your clipboard protection using this identicon is way less secure than in Ethereum. For ethereum to make an identical identicon would take years and to make one similar would take days or weeks, while in nimiq generating a fake identicon (identical) it takes 2 minutes.",neg

Oh yeah, looks like Gervais is behind Liquidity Network. So not an independent point.",neg
"I will add that Nimiq team is not capable of generating its own partnerships. All Nimiq's existing partnerships were formed by outside parties coming to them. In that way Nimiq is like a freeloader that accepts free shit from other people, but is incapable of providing enough value to initiate partnerships it desires itself. To be clear, this means that all existing exchanges which Nimiq is on was a result of the exchange coming to Nimiq, but if Nimiq initiates the contact with an exchange e.g. Bittrex, the exchange is not interested since Nimiq is not bringing much value to the table itself. I hope I make myself clear.",neg
"   You are welcome! There are many more stuff compromised to enable the ""magic"" of browser blockchain. For instance, 90%+ of miners are using the nano/pico consensus which means they can get trickered if an attacker is making a fork with K (where k is the security constant of the last k blocks verified). If an attacker is making a 50%+1 attack of the network for K blocks, all pico/nano miners which are most, will get compromised also. I don't remember exactly the value of K, but I remember it was 120 blocks (like 2 hours). Making 50%+1 for 2 hours and you own the ENTIRE network unless they do a hard fork to reject the new Account Tree with new balances. Look. Nimiq nazi, we are not that stupid at all.

"   There is engineering yes, but its all derivative and unoriginal. Anyway that is not the reason for the collaboration, as I will prove by the following extract from one of your blog posts:  Quote In addition to its own efforts, Nimiq is sponsoring blockchain research at Stanford University’s Applied Cryptography Group under Dan Boneh (since August 2018) and a PhD position at Imperial College’s Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering under Arthur Gervais (since October 2017). Most recently Nimiq sponsored the 1st International Summer School on Security & Privacy for Blockchains and Distributed Ledger Technologies, a program jointly organized by members of the Technical University of Vienna (TU Wien) and Princeton University.

This is the biggest pump and dumb I've ever seen......,neg
   Chaincoin with its HODL movement was the last one that comes to mind that pumped this hard. We all know how that train wreck turned out.,neg
  yeah sell. its a scam. don't think you would get a real buyer,neg
Guys don't invest in this. Clearly its a pump n dump. The signs are obvious.,neg
"Clearly this coin is pump and dump , so don't invest in this scam coin",neg
"Just as I thought, it dumped. I hope the people who put money into this junk coin learned something. It is a red flag when price shoots up over 100% in such a short time.   ",neg
this SCAM can't be more obvious... I doubt somebody is actually buying this shitcoin.. it's all artificial pump and coinmarketcap abuse,neg
   Totally agreed all people should stay away from this scam project if they want to lose their hard earned. Just manipulation in the market with fake volume and big price to trap the newcomers to dump on them.,neg
"It may well be fraud ... The site is not allowing to withdraw as ""access denied""",neg
"   I registered an account. They got me:  ""UCASH Available: 288.46945645 UCASH"".  When i try to transfer them to BTC-Alpha they ask a Network fees per transaction : 300 UCASH... 300 UCASH, are, at the actual market price, around $46,00      SCAMMMMMM!",neg
The project really looks like a scam I ordered withdrawal Ucash tokens from my dashboard on the site and wait for two days,neg
   This has got to be one of the most foolish comments I've seen on here. So it doesn't matter if something is a scam as long as you make money from it? What a stupid thing to say! You are the kind of person scammers love to steal from. And you sound like a shameless scammer!,neg
When any market will be moving like this how Ucash is doing on coinmarketcap what kind of response do you expect. It is a classical example of manipulation based on mountain of supply to get it there at that high. How long would you be able to sustain that place is to be watched. It will be interesting to see coming days.,neg
"Obvious  scam or pump and dump.  With Ucash being on only one minor exchange, and volume of only 3 million when others at that marketcap have volumes of over 50 million, get ready to lose your money if you go for this.  This is not FUD, just common sense from what the statistics are saying.",neg
"i consider this project very hilarious.  - low volume on small exchange but marketcap of top25 - bought facebook likes - a very funny ""opening our office"" video with 2 guys talking, one guy putting his backhead into the camera so it looks like if there are ppl autending, some fake sounds (claps etc), and voila.  imo a clearly scam.",neg
   The big portion of the supply is under control by a person or group of pumpers so they are moving the price like that on unknown exchange there is possibility maybe there are too involve into this scam. Totally stupid concept and some unknown people want to scam people.,neg
"   Be quiet my friend you don't know who i am and for what i did that, then please be relax and take it easy!!!  Affiliate bonus... !!!!! they freeze the affiliate bonus because they are scammer, and the people searching the affiliate bonus are the ""only"" reason of these scammers!!!   And be relaxing with pronuncing some words... cause the reason of comunity is to prevent the scammers and moon promisers!! OK??  Regards",neg
These Scam's crash the market all the time... f'n oppurtunists.,neg
    BTC alpha must also be a scam  This coin is up over 200% at only BTC alpha  Smells like an eca and coinsmarket like scam to me where the dev and the exchange are the same...,neg
"If you look at their ICO rating (icobench) you will see that they are rated with 2, so be careful with investing...  -cash",neg
"   It's an ERC20 token, that's the first indication you have to look into the project in more detail. Nothing more dangerous than an unsecure ERC20 token. ERC20 tokens aren't bad per se (I own some), but can be abused, alla Monero Gold, which was most definitely a scam. This essentially making the same big claims that Monero Gold was, Debit Card etc. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Also, you can't just climb into the top 25 of CMC with a blossoming coin/token out the gate from some obscure exchanges without some suspected manipulation.  2 + 2 is 4 - 1 that 3 Quick maths.",neg
"     A fool and his money are soon parted.  It has all the markings, I don't know how you can't see it. The fact that it's ""just the potential it could be one [scam]"" is mindblowing you'd go anywhere near it.  Good luck to you friend! I wish you many Lamborghinis with all of your UCASH.",neg
    he's either pumping or invested obv. now they are dumping this crap. let's watch the UCRASH going back to 0,neg
"So am I the only one confused about this coin and website?  1.) the mobile verification dont work, have tried many times over 2 days and it never calls me  2.) the live chat says the same representatives are always their, they dont sleep? and I got no reply after 24 hours  3.) most stuff don't work and theirs no real info anywhere kind of circular  4.) their is one webpage on the site that shows that the IBO started in November 2017 and that all 16 levels of IBO are finished but this ANN was just posted and then their are 2 other pages that shows IBO levels and info. that are total contradictions.    I'm totally confused as to what the deal is with this coin/site.  If I had to take a long shot in the dark I would say that its a phishing scam for your identity.  Name, address, phone number, drivers license, birth certificate, passport, etc. etc. etc.  IMO you should STAY AWAY at least in terms of providing any information thats not public until alot of people have better comments then my personal experience with trying to figure this out.  This looks bad on every level possible  it also don't help that the exchange listed alpha-btc is extremely suspect as well.  the site seems unable to handle any traffic and the prices on their just make no sense.  Note: I only spent all of 45 seconds bothering with this site but BTC was listed at $9100 while BTC was worth 8500",neg
"Circulating Supply 8 635 355 959 UCASH  Price $0,098269 USD  Market Cap $848 589 522 USD  Volume (24h) $878 265 USD   I bet most people who own this crap have somewhere around 1000-50000 tokens, I hope you feel unique owning so much out of close to 9 bilion circulating supply. Volume... with so many tokens in circulation isn't it suspicious so little is traded? Price rising hardcore on absolute shit volume? Do you ever ask yourself these questions? No red flags?  If you wonder why btc is crashing it is because these people take your bitcoins and buy themselves lambos with it.  People... do basic math... use common sense... Don't get scammed...",neg
ITS A SCAM THEY SEND TO ME AN MAIL I HAVE 5150 U CASH PROCESING TO WITHDRAW IN MY WALLET AND THEY SEND ME THE MAIL: Your withdrawal request has been denied due to suspicious activity in your account.

"     Why wait thirty days? If the wallet and staff, should be free to move it whenever you want, The bonus who must control and the system itself so that it is not interfered in the wallet",neg
"This is how the ucash scam works. First they make you open a wallet and give you coins, and then you can not withdraw the coins. With the coins lock up in your walllet the price will go up, and then they dump the coins that they have on the exchange. They also ask for your ID to get your information, to open credit in your name, when they shit coin fail. Fools wake up and smell the coffee.",neg

I am sick of all these low life scammers, that give crypto a bad name. Mark my words, this shit coin will be back to where it belong, at the bottom of the shit pile. Think guys, if it is free, there is a catch. The only reason this shit coin is in the top 100 on cmc, is because you can not get access to sell the coin.

On Thursday I wrote again but this time in English, they did not read it, of course, they did not respond. On Friday morning they deposited in my account the amount of 62360 ETT corresponding to 1 ETH. I write again in English and ask them when they will deposit the missing tokens, after 4 days, there is no answer. I hope by this means that someone from the staff that works at Eternal Trust can read it and credit me in my account the tokens that they owe me. To facilitate your work, I enclose the screenshots of etherscan.io and my wallet in Eternal Trust so they can solve the problem.

"В чем выгода инвесторов? Хедж-Фонд CRISSE обязуется в декабре 2018, после премьеры фильма в кинотеатрах России, СНГ и Европы - выкупить токены у инвесторов за 30% чистой прибыли от проката, трансляции на ТВ и продажи DVD, а также 30% прибыли от продажи игрушек и компьютерных игр с использованием персонажей главных героев фильма РЕАНИМАТОР.  Ориентировочно по бизнес-плану в декабре 2018 - 1 токен REANIMATOR= 3 USD Второй этап- создание технологии CRYPTOMOVIE. 30 декабря 2019 - хедж-фонд CRISSE начинает выкупать токены RNM за 30 % прибыли от контрактов с мировыми киностудиями, продюсерскими центрами кино и ведущими сетями кинотеатров о внедрении технологии CRYPTOMOVIE. Минимальная цена выкупа 1 RNM= 6 USD (эквивалент в биткоинах и эфириуме) и максимальная – 10 USD.  P.S. 30 октября 2017 17:00 по Московскому времени - 5 ноября 2017  17:00 по Московскому времени Pre-ICO  - 2 миллиона токенов REANIMATOR  выставляются на продажу со скидкой 80% (по цене 0,2 USD) на  платформе Waves через биржу DEX.

"Мировой кинематограф сегодня испытывает большие трудности в плане реализации оригинальных идей. 99% фильмов выпускаются под копирку. Римейки и перезапуски франшиз, фильмы основанные на одних и тех же сюжетных линиях, лишь слегка видоизменив их. Вся проблема в том, что крупные кинокомпании (особенно в Голливуде) не решаются вкладывать деньги в новые идеи и новые сценарии. Продюсеры работают синхронно с руководством кинокомпаний, не пытаясь найти жемчужину в океане новых сценариев, а лишь повторяя одни и те же сюжеты, уже высосанные вниманием зрителей ранее.  Это полный регресс киноиндустрии мира. Тотальное дно. Сегодня этот мир нуждается в революции. А точнее - в совершенно новом подходе к качеству фильмов в плане бюджета, сюжета и технического совершенства.  Теперь не трусливые продюсеры, а сами люди будут выбирать и инвестировать в новые кинопроекты. Настала эра новых режиссёров и новых сюжетов, никогда ранее не выпускавшихся на экраны кинотеатров! Удар нокаут по Голливуду и эта революция в кино будет свершена именно в России!",delete
" В жопу кинематогроф вместе телевизороматографом , зделайте , что нибудь полезное , если бы игрался в хайпы вложил бы в лавка лавку , искренне верю , что тс4 здует с планеты всю многоцветную нечесть",delete
"Создать что-то полезное? НЕ стоит недооценивать финансовый потенциал кинематографа. Мировой оборот  киноиндустрии в 2016 году составил свыше 38,6 миллиарда долларов. Четвёртая в мире модель бизнеса по прибыльности, после наркотиков, оружия и проституции.  Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР не привлечения инвестиций в бюджет фильма  РЕАНИМАТОР (хотя это тоже очень важно). Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР – создание ВПЕРВЫЕ В МИРЕ прозрачной сетки БЮДЖЕТА и ДОХОДА от кинопроката любых фильмов – компьютерной программы CRYPTOMOVIE.  Что это значит? После кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, 40% прибыли будет потрачено на создание специальной запатентованной технологии блокчейна – компьютерная программа CRYPTOMOVIE.  CRYPTOMOVIE позволит обезопасить создателей любых будущих кинопроектов (кинокомпании, студии и продюсерские центры) от махинаций и подтасовки результатов  суммы сборов от кинопроката любого фильма на международном рынке. Например, если на фильм АВАТАР Джеймса Кэмерона  официально  было продано билетов в мире на сумму свыше 700 миллионов долларов, то не официально эта сумма достигает свыше 1,5 миллиардов долларов. Почему? Потому что кинотеатры «прячут» 20-50% количества проданных билетов и доказать эту фальсификацию невозможно. Чтобы исключить махинации в этом  кинопрокатном секторе - все анонсы кинофильмов и заказы кинобилетов будут размещаться на сайте CRYPTOMOVIE. В результате все билеты на любой фильм, в любой стране и в любом кинотеатре будут напрямую выкупаться кинозрителями на сайте CRYPTOMOVIE.IO или с помощью мобильного приложения CRYPTOMOVIE за криптовалюту Waves или за фиатные деньги при помощи банковской карты или  электронных кошельков. В случае например онлайн-покупки кино-билета за фиатные деньги,  система CRYPTOMOVIE  автоматически трансформирует и отошлёт платёж в криптовалюте Waves на соответствующий каждому фильму свой уникальный кошелёк Waves, который периодически заводит в системе сеть кинотеатров после каждой премьеры нового фильма. Все данные таким образом, о количестве и цене проданных билетов оседают в блокчейне Waves. Далее, после выкупа кинозрителем билета в кино, эту информацию система  CRYPTOMOVIE. автоматически  передаёт по зашифрованному каналу в дата-центр соответствующего кинотеатра, где покупатель, в зависимости от его желания - или получает классический билет на бумажном носителе по первому запросу в кассе кинотеатра  при предъявлении QR-кода, выданном после онлайн-покупки билета или предъявляет этот QR-код контролёру со сканером  в момент входа в кино-зал. В том случае, если у зрителя нет возможности онлайн-оплаты билета, в холле любого кинотеатра будет размещён специальный мини-терминал по продаже кинобилетов за  криптовалюту Waves,  с использованием наличных фиат-денег. Терминалы онлайн-продажи кино-билетов во всех кинотеатрах будут размещать или сами кинотеатры или независимые владельцы за 0,5% вознаграждения от каждого выкупленного билета через их терминал. Итог: все данные о количестве выкупленных билетов на тот или иной фильм невозможно подделать так как хранятся на блокчейн-платформе Waves.  Таким образом, владельцев фильма невозможно обмануть, и они получают ровно столько денег от кинопроката, сколько было продано билетов (в соответствии с индивидуальными условиями процентного разделения доходов от продажи кино-билетов с каждой сетью кинотеатров). Фильм РЕАНИМАТОР выйдет в кинопрокат в декабре 2018 - в России, СНГ, Европе и Китае. Пилотная версия кинопроката РЕАНИМАТОР с использованием MVP формы продажи билетов по системе CRYPTOMOVIE выйдет в 12 кинотеатрах Швейцарии в мае 2019 года.  P.S. А теперь представьте что каждый фильм в этом  38-миллиардном обороте будет привязан к технологии CRYPTOMOVIE.  Условия продажи лицензии технологии CRYPTOMOVIE – 2 % от продажи кинобилетов.  Разве это не полезное событие для  инвесторов и кинопродюсеров?",delete

"   Кокой орегенальный сюжет! Вас ждёт мировой успех!    Бюджет фильма-10 миллионов USD.  Ожидается, что съемки фильма начнутся в марте 2018 года и пройдут в России, Германии, Италии и Китае. На главные роли режиссер намерен пригласить Стивена Сигала и Данилу Козловского. Сейчас ведутся переговоры с их агентами.  Это шутка? Я думаю, что Сигал за весь бюджет фильма не разрешит упомянуть своё имя, не говоря уже про участие в съёмках ",delete
" Стивен Сигал берёт за 1 съёмочный день  в разы больше,  чем берут супер кинозвёзды. Например как Том Круз или Дуэйн Джонсон.  Мы общаемся с его агентом. И нашу кинокоманду устраивает его  разумная цена, которая очень легко вписывается в бюджет нашего фильма. Весь вопрос сейчас идёт в согласовании даты съёмок и сценария. Наш бюджет уже набран в размере 1,6 миллиона USD от Эстонского хедж-фонда CRISSE, проводящего данное ICO. Поэтому фильм РЕАНИМАТОР стартует в любом случае. Сюжет РЕАНИМАТОРА действительно оригинален и он единственный в истории кино и печатных изданий. Где и когда до сих пор был такой фильм или печатная публикация с подобной идеей? НИГДЕ и НИКОГДА.

"У нашей команды опыт съёмок и проката фильмов с 2005 года. Делали фильмы с максимальным бюджетом 1,5 миллиона USD.

Достигнута договорённость с Министерством культуры РФ о получении на него прокатного удостоверения, потому что фильм РЕАНИМАТОР пропагандирует среди молодёжи здоровый образ жизни. Также возрастной рейтинг фильма будет +6. Поэтому прокат начинается с 9 утра и до позднего вечера, охватывая тем самым максимум аудитории. Дети и подростки  полюбят этот фильм. А они  ходят в кино с родителями, тем самым увеличивая средний чек покупки кинобилетов. Также нами достигнута договорённость о прокате фильма РЕАНИМАТОР в Китае. Учитывая что в Китае кинотеатров больше чем в США (50.000 против 40.000)-это большой плюс с кинопроката в Поднебесной.

"Ответы на вопросы: 1) Вы хотя бы в википедии почитайте, что такое хромосомы и ДНК. ДНК содержится в хромосоме, а не наоборот! Какой ""научно-фантастический"" фильм вы собрались снимать?..  Ответ: Речь идёт о хромосомной молекуле ДНК. Также и сами хромосомы бывают разными. В данном случае по сценарию фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, мы говорим о хромосомах с азотистыми основаниями. А в хромосомных молекулах ДНК хромосом человека насчитывается от 50 до 245 миллионов пар азотистых оснований.  2) Что это за команда и какие фильмы вы уже сняли?

А это серьёзный контингент дающий около 25-30 % кассовых сборов в России и в Китае. НО молодое поколение не знает Стивена. Поэтому в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР будет сниматься известный российской молодёжи киноактер Данила Козловский, который даёт около 40% кассовых сборов за счет контингента в возрасте от 12-25 лет. 2) Гонорар Стивена за 1 съёмочный день - коммерческая тайна.",delete

"  Свежая новость:  Кинороль  или рекламу в фантастическом  фильме РЕАНИМАТОР можно теперь купить за криптовалюту. Эстонский Хедж-фонд CRISSE, при согласии российской кинокомпании ЛАМ, продаёт всем желающим кинороли в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР за  внутреннюю криптовалюту- токены REANIMATOR (RNM) на платформе Waves. Речь идёт о не главных и второстепенных ролях. Например роль бравого русского СПЕЦНАЗОВЦА  в сцене облавы в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР, обойдётся в 3000 токенов REANIMATOR . А вот роль одного из бандитов головорезов   в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР, обойдётся на порядок дороже – 30.000 монет. А можно и вовсе не сниматьсяся в фильме, а просто появиться в качестве автора книги, которая будет лежать на столе у главного героя РЕАНИМАТОРА. Но за это желающему придётся выложить уже 100.000 токенов. Кроме того, внутри фильма РЕАНИМАТОР можно за виртуальные токены купить и ненавязчивую рекламу. Авторы ICO REANIMATOR уверяют что такая реклама будет органично встроенной в сюжет. Что бы ни окружало РЕАНИМАТОРА - автомобили, биржи, банки, криптовалюта, техника, одежда, украшения, все эти бренды можно купить за криптовалюту по цене до 1 миллиона токенов. Авторы проекта ICO REANIMATOR, кинопродюсер Алан Клаудис и Руслан Магомадов, считают, что таким образом они убьют двух зайцев: во первых привлекут с помощью криптовалют в свой ICO проект частных лиц, мечтающих стать кинозвёздами и рекламодателей желающих купить недорого рекламу с мировой аудиторией, а во вторых - продвигать популярность криптовалют в России и в мире.

"Ответы на вопрос: Вопрос: Совсем не убедили. Ваша команда делала практически никому неизвестные фильмы, которые показывались на узкоспециализированных или третьесортных фестивалях. А теперь вы замахнулись на мега-кино с Сигалом и обещаете грандиозные сборы по всему миру. Появилось ещё больше сомнений.  Во первых, Джеймс Кэмерон из Канады, Нил Бломкамп из ЮАР, тоже когда-то начинали с малобюджетных  и никому неизвестных фильмов.  Также и наши бюджеты предыдущих фильмов  укладывались в рамки 1,5 миллиона USD. Но это не значит что всю жизнь надо сидеть в этой нише и не стремиться к большому кино. Во вторых наша команда в рамках фильма РЕАНИМАТОР не замахивается мега-кино со Стивеном Сигалом. Мы замахиваемся на малобюджетное кино с малоизвестными в мире  актерами  бюджетом до 10 миллионов USD. Мега -кино это бюджеты от 100 миллионов USD. Вот наш следующий после РЕАНИМАТОРА фильм будет  действительно Мега проектом: фантастический фильм АНДРОИД. Это фильм о том, что раса людей- это бывшие  10 миллионов лет назад  2  андроида , на службе у сверхгуманоидов в далёкой галактике, но бежавшие от своих  хозяев и нашедшие новую Родину-Землю.",delete

Да  и статистика по сборам говорит о том же. Может вы просто запустите ICO по привлечению хороших сценаристов? Способных написать годный сценарий. Ответ: Это не сценарий. Это лишь СИНОПСИС.  Оценивать успех будущего фильма по его синопсису, это все равно что оценивать в темноте формы и дизайн суперкара с повязкой на глазах, на ощупь. Дождитесь утра и снимете повязку-тогда вы увидите стоит ли восхищения суперкар. Дождитесь  кинопроката РЕАНИМАТОРА в сентябре 2018  и вы будете поражены его супер идеей и достоверностью повествования. Сценарий РЕАНИМАТОРА имеет настолько оригинальный и единственный в мире ход сюжетной линии, что привлечёт к себе внимание огромного количества кинозрителей и телезрителей. Российский фильм РЕАНИМАТОР  станет настолько же культовым фильмом, каким в 1979 году стал фильм БЕЗУМНЫЙ МАКС с бюджетом 99 тысяч австралийских долларов, принёсший его создателям кассовые сборы 120 миллионов долларов. Об этом фильме будет говорить и дети и старики.  Главная причина коммерческого успеха фильма- оригинальность сюжета  и талант режиссёра. От работы режиссера зависит правдоподобная игра актеров и соответственно 40% успеха. От идеи фильма зависит 50% успеха.  Остальные 10% - компьютерная графика, юмор и экшн. В фильме РЕАНИМАТОР будут использованы все 3 фактора. Главные актёры режиссёром РЕАНИМАТОРА уже выбраны: Стивен Сигал и Данила Козловский. Остальные второстепенные актёры - будут набираться после проведения ICO REANIMATOR на 30-дневном кастинге в Москве.  Более того, ядро кинопроекта РЕАНИМАТООР- это технология CRYPTOMOVIE. В рамках ICO РЕАНИМАТОР, эстонский хедж-фонд CRISSE, с апреля 2018 -  создаёт уникальную технологию CRYPTOMOVIE, основанную на блокчейне. CRYPTOMOVIE призвана обезопасить мировых кинопродюсеров от фальсификации по кассовым сборам любых кинофильмов. Например, если на фильм АВАТАР Джеймса Кэмерона  официально было продано билетов в мире на сумму свыше 700 миллионов долларов, то не официально эта сумма достигает свыше 1,5 миллиардов долларов. Почему? Потому что кинотеатры «прячут» 20-50% количества проданных билетов и доказать эту фальсификацию невозможно. Чтобы исключить махинации в этом  кинопрокатном секторе - все анонсы кинофильмов и заказы кинобилетов будут вшиты в технологию CRYPTOMOVIE. Более подробно смотрите Whitepaper.  Возвращаясь снова к теме уникальности сюжетной линии и главной идеи фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Сюжет РЕАНИМАТОРА действительно оригинален и он единственный в мировой истории кино и печатных изданий. Идея очень проста: Человек может с помощью изменения одной молекулы ДНК в хромосоме, избавиться от всех вредных привычек (алкоголь,наркотики,курение,плохой режим дня,лень,неправильное питание и т.д.). Эта молекула ДНК как лампочка  которую можно включить и выключить. Надо лишь подобрать к ней ключ. В результате такого изменения ДНК, человек рефлекторно не сможет совершить ничего, что нанесёт малейший вред структуре ткани его тела или моральному спокойствию. Главный герой РЕАНИМАТОРА, таким образом,  естественным путём трансформирует свои тело  и разум, путём  идеальных физических  и психологических нагрузок. Также он  максимально развивает  свой мозг, потому что мозг как мышца и его  можно тренировать, повышая его упругость и силу.  Получает знания эффекта Плацебо, самогипноза, направленного гипноза, выносливости, реакции,образного  и нестандартного мышления,  развивает ""второе дыхание"" и т.д. Расширяет рамки возможностей своего разума и организма  почти до бесконечности. И все это повторяю путем естественного процесса, без применения какой-либо химии. Вообще, главный стержень мысли РЕАНИМАТОРА в том, что любой человек в мире, даже самый безнадёжный в моральном и физическом плане- может  самостоятельно стать идеальным за короткий срок 1-2 года, при наличии лишь одной силы воли. Где и когда до сих пор был такой фильм или печатная публикация с подобной идеей? НИГДЕ и НИКОГДА. РЕАНИМАТОР будет иметь феноменальный успех у мировой аудитории. Наша  профессиональная кино-команда абсолютно уверена в этом.",delete

"Ответы на вопросы: 1) Вопрос: В данной теме затронуто две острых темы , во первых Россия, во вторых кино. А вместе получается прям термоядерная смесь. 30% от мнимых условных доходов в 18 году? Вы там перегрелись наверное? Ответ:  Не стоит недооценивать потенциал российского кино. Тимура Бекмамбетова тоже в начале 2000-ых считали фантазёром, носившимся по коридорам  ТВ и приемным спонсоров со своим безумным сценарием Ночного дозора. Но тем не менее фильм принес доход 1 к 10. Наш фильм соберет в прокате не менее такого коэффициента. Сюжет РЕАНИМАТОРА  и сама идея фильма настолько оригинальны и уникальны,что никогда ранее не были экранизированы или напечатаны.  НЕ важно в какой стране ты родился и где учился, чтобы снять коммерчески успешный фильм. Важно другое: талант и сила воли. 2) Вопрос: Без регулирования и ответственности инвестирование в эту идею = отправка денег в одну сторону. А и да... и причем тут блокчейн? Ответ: А)  В примере ICO REANIMATOR речь идёт о венчурном инвестировании, которое всегда было высокорисковым делом. Поэтому и прибыли в сотни раз выше чем инвестиции в простые фиатные проекты. Например банковский депозит. Пожалуйста...В банковском депозите присутствует и регулирование в лице государства и ответственность банка по страховке вклада. Риск минимальный и соответственно доход минимальный 8-15% в год. Вердикт: Кто готов пожертвовать малым, тот получит малое. Кто готов пожертвовать многим - тот получит много. Б)  Блокчейн имеет прямое отношение к кино-проекту ICO REANIMATOR. В рамках ICO РЕАНИМАТОР, эстонский хедж-фонд CRISSE, создаёт уникальную технологию CRYPTOMOVIE, основанную на блокчейне. CRYPTOMOVIE призвана обезопасить мировых кинопродюсеров от фальсификации по кассовым сборам любых кинофильмов.  Более подробно это описано в разделе Whitepaper на сайте  3) Вопрос: Но возможно фонд кино или спонсоры поняли несостоятельность проекта, или хотели слишком большой откат, и хитрецы просто решили подсобрать бабла с инвесторов - и ответственности перед ними, вслучае чего, нет, и откатов, и рекламу пихать не надо. Ответ: Авторы кино-проекта принципиально не обратились за финансированием к государству в лице Фонда Кино и ему подобных структур. Потому что именно в таком случае и не было бы никакой ответственности за качество кино. Не было бы стимула выложиться на все 100% чтобы вернуть потраченные средства. В случае ICO REANIMATOR  у кино-команды есть абсолютная ответственность за качество фильма РЕАНИМАТОР перед  всеми инвесторами, желающими вернуть свои деньги с прибылью. 4) Вопрос: Кинотеатры не будут покупать такое кино потому что на малобюджетное не ходят. Ответ: Зрители не хотят смотреть  специально только высокобюджетное кино. Для них не имеет никакого значения снят фильм на 100 миллионов долларов или на 100 тысяч долларов. Зрители хотят смотреть качественное кино с оригинальной идеей, продуманным сюжетом и хорошей игрой актеров, которое заставляет задуматься и анализировать. Простой пример: Безумный Макс  с бюджетом 100 тысяч долларов собрал в прокате  с коэффициентом 1 к 100 = 100 миллионов долларов. 5)  Вопрос: В течение многих лет казалось: франшиза с оптимистичным названием Re-Animator - мертвее мертвого. Но настоящие фанаты никогда не теряли надежды на то, что одержимое порождение сумрачного гения Говарда Лавкрафта, доктор Уэст, вернется на экраны еще хотя бы раз, продолжив маньячески манипулировать своей живительной сывороткой. Ответ: Российский фильм РЕАНИМАТОР  и американский фильм РЕ-АНИМАТОР это совершенно разные по содержанию,смыслу и сюжету кинопродукты. С франшизой никаких проблем нет. Дело в том, что в отличие от американского законодательства, в котором четко прописано, что авторским правом названия произведений вовсе не охраняются, российское законодательство предоставляет охрану названиям произведений, но только в том случае, если название произведения создано творческим трудом автора и ""может использоваться самостоятельно"".  Вердикт:  В США нет права на франшизу названия фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. В России также нет проблем с франшизой  названия фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Потому что в России  сегодня никто не владеет франшизой на слово РЕАНИМАТОР в названии художественного фильма.  Но,даже если гипотетически допустить такое возможным, кино-команда фильма РЕАНИМАТОР просто навсего купит за символическую цену франшизу названия фильма словом РЕАНИМАТОР.",delete

"Ответы на вопросы: Вопрос: Здесь, возможно, и не российские кинопроизводители виноваты, а система с фондом кино и сборами денег на картину. Вся эта система не направлена на создание качественного продукта, а на распил бабла между создателями и ""деньгодателями"". Оттуда и результат - плачевный продукт.  Ну а печальнее всего что теперь ребята пытаются эту же схему перенести в крипту и пилить теперь уже не бюджетные деньги, а бабло инвесторов. Если бы создатели брали кредит под залог квартиры и отдавали его из кассовых сборов, то наверняка о качестве сценария заботились бы куда уж больше Ответ: Кинокомпания ""ЛАМ""  никогда не брала деньги с Фонда Кино. Все наши фильмы до сих завоевывали первые или вторые места на международных кинофестивалях. Бюджет фильма РЕАНИМАТОР в сумме 1,6 миллиона USD уже есть. Поэтому съемки и прокат будут любом случае. Финансирование инвесторов лишь усилит качество спецэффектов и позволит привлечь к съемкам звезд кино. Вопрос: Может я в какой-то другой вселенной живу, но вы показываете всем даже не сценарий, одно предложение, ссылаясь на которое пытаетесь привлечь деньги. При этом обещаете золотые горы. Ответ: Любой желающий принять участие в инвестировании ICO REANIMATOR, может получить по первому требованию для ознакомления сценарий фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР в виде расширенного синопсиса на 26 страниц. Для этого необходимо сделать письменный запрос на адрес:  ico@reanimator.io",delete

Но - самая большая доля успеха в кино - сценарий и удачная его реализация режиссером. ВНо сейчас, к сожалению, последнее слово за продюсером а не режиссером, поэтому и трудно реализовать задумки.

Ответ: Во главе угла любого успешного фильма всегда стоит ИДЕЯ сценария  и ТАЛАНТ вместе с творческим настроем его исполнителей.  Идея сценария РЕАНИМАТОРА никогда ранее не была ни экранизирована ни напечатана. Суть - человек с помощью силы воли может тотально трансформировать свой организм и мозг, добиваясь колоссальных позитивных изменений в своей жизни. Сила воли носителя доводится до абсолюта с помощью укола сыворотки ОМЕГА.  Вопрос: Как по мне, идея скользкая. Кинематограф СНГ очень слаб.  Сигалу понравился ваш сценарий?Сколько стоит у него день съемок (хоть ориентировочно)? Вы уверены что у вас на все бюджета хватит?  Ответ: Это факт. Кинематограф СНГ в зачаточном состоянии сегодня. Фильм РЕАНИМАТОР станет первым прорывом в этой сфере, ломающим все стереотипы. Сигал даже не читал сценарий. Его больше интересует гонорар. Бюджета уже сегодня хватит в имеющемся размере в сумме 1,6 миллиона USD.  Вопрос: Что ж, честь вам и хвала, что не вляпывались в истории с фондом кино. А на фестивалях вы занимали места именно с коммерческими лентами или с авторским кино? Все-таки это очень разные сферы.  Ответ: На международных кино-фестивалях мы не занимали места именно с коммерческими лентами. Только авторские кинофильмы.

"   Стивен Сигал будет дублироваться на другие языки и не дублироваться для проката  фильма в англоговорящих странах.

После кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, 40% прибыли будет потрачено на создание специальной запатентованной технологии блокчейна – компьютерная программа CRYPTOMOVIE.

Между тем, Стивен Сигал, достаточно известный для  старшего поколения мировой кино-актер. Он хорошо  и правдоподобно играет свою роль. Это главное.  А то, насколько Стивен известен сегодня молодой кино-аудитории  мира это уже риторический вопрос, не относящийся глобально к коммерческому успеху РЕАНИМАТОРА.",delete

После кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, 40% прибыли будет потрачено на создание специальной запатентованной технологии блокчейна –  программа CRYPTOMOVIE.  CRYPTOMOVIE позволит обезопасить создателей любых будущих кинопроектов (кинокомпании, студии и продюсерские центры) от махинаций и подтасовки результатов  суммы сборов от кинопроката любого фильма на международном рынке.

Никогда до сих пор в мировой истории кинематографа или печатных СМИ, не было экранизировано или опубликовано идеи, которая есть в сюжетной линии фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. ИДЕЯ ФИЛЬМА РЕАНИМАТОР: Главный герой с помощью абсолютной силы воли, полученной благодаря инъекции Омеги, производит масштабные изменения своей личной жизни и жизни всего человечества: питание, образование, спорт, здоровье, спец-тренировки интеллекта и мозга, построение крупного бизнеса, обучение гипнозу и манипулирование сознанием.

"Ожидается что около 70% дохода с фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, поступит за счет проката в сети фирменных кинотеатров Китая. Дело в том, что количество кинотеатров в Китае побило мировой рекорд, превысив тот же показатель в США. Число кинотеатров в стране превышает 40,9 тысячи и составляет 40 917, что на 158 больше, чем в Америке, которая раньше возглавляла рейтинг с 40 759 кинотеатрами. По мнению местных обозревателей, это связано с постоянно повышающимся уровнем благосостояния китайцев и постепенным формированием потребительского общества в стране. Команда кино-проекта REANIMATOR еще в сентября 2017 получила предварительное согласие от компании China Film Group на право проката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР на территории Китая. Достичь этого удалось благодаря соответствию сценария РЕАНИМАТОРА ряду требований Главного государственного управления по делам прессы, печати, радиовещания, кинематографии и телевидения КНР: 1) Отсутствие в фильме религиозной парадигмы, включая все теологические постулаты 2) Отсутствие мистицизма 3) Зло в фильме должно быть наказано добром 4) Сотрудник правоохранительных органов в кино принципиально не может быть преступником, а халатность государственных структур не должна служить причиной катастрофы  Это колоссальное достижение, учитывая что квота на кино-прокат в Китае составляет всего 32 зарубежных проекта в год.

"Впервые вижу такой проект! По-сути, если развить идею, получается, что зритель сам выбирает, в какой фильм инвестировать свои средства, а потом получает их обратно в зависимости от успешности проката? Это действительно что-то новое. Но именно в России есть такая проблема, что у сомнительных комедий большие сборы, а какое-нибудь хорошее авторское кино в просадке. То есть если хочешь инвестировать с точки зрения получения прибыли в дальнейшем, то придется инвестировать в ""плохое кино"", а если хочешь инвестировать в хорошую картину - то только ради ее поддержки, не стоит ждать больших возвратов от нее. (безусловно, везде есть исключения, говорю в целом).",delete
    Именно! У этой идеи большое будущее и проект Reanimator будет первым успешным кинопроектом прошедшем ICO.,delete
"   Вот задаюсь тем же вопросом. С одной стороны хотелось бы поддержать хорошую кинокартину, а с другой хочется и заработать.

"  Ну пассивный доход - тоже доход, ведь так? А что, действительно в России и СНГ так плохо с кинопрокатом? Я думал что уж в кино то люди ходят, в отличии от всяких выставок/музеев/театров итд. Или во всем виноват высокий уровень пиратства?",delete

"ВЫБРАНА ГЕОЛОКАЦИЯ РЕАНИМАТОРА В НЕПАЛЕ. Сегодня утром, для съёмок финальных сцен фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР,  кино-компания ЛАМ,  окончательно утвердила базовый лагерь у подножия гор Гималаи. Это высокогорная деревня Пун Хилл в Непале– 3 километра над уровнем моря.   По сценарию в горах Гималаи, Реаниматор и его соратники, построят секретный завод-лабораторию по производству лекарства Омеги для человечества. По сценарию, финансирование на создание лаборатории Реаниматор получит от Сатоши Накамото, в виде одного миллиона Биткоинов. Создатель биткоина, разделяет идею Реаниматора - очищение цивилизации от всех пороков: алкоголь, табак, наркотики, вредное питание и лень. Таким образом Омега создаёт импульс новых горизонтов самопознания человека и резкий скачок эволюции Хомо-Сапиенс, как вида.  Сами сцены производства завода Омеги, будут сниматься непосредственно в горах Гималаи, в условиях разреженного воздуха.   Для этого, специальной ячейке кино-группы в составе 25 человек, а также главным кино-актерам, придется предварительно пройти усиленную 2-недельную тренировку с целью безболезненной адаптации к нахождению в экстремальной среде на высоте 8 километров над уровнем моря. Съёмки в горах Гималаи продлятся по графику -  7 дней в апреле 2018.  P.S. Напоминаем что фантастический фильм РЕАНИМАТОР будет снят и выпущен в международный кино-прокат в 2018 году, в любом случае.

"КРИЗИС РОССИЙСКОГО КИНЕМАТОГРАФА «СКУЧНО, СТЫДНО И ПРОТИВНО»  Стыд и позор русскому кино –вот наше первое впечатление от сценария русского фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР в феврале 2017.  В феврале 2017, в нашем головном офисе, я и мои коллеги, на очередной утренней пятиминутке, долго смеялись и прикалывались над письмом от российской кино- компании ЛАМ в адрес нашей компании. В письме был описан короткий и убогий синопсис их будущего фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, о какой-то смешной сыворотке, меняющей ДНК человека.  Мало того, что это была почти точная и наглая копия фильма ОБЛАСТИ ТЬМЫ. Это еще полбеды.  Мы посмотрели трейлер фильма РЕАНИМАТОР и мы были просто в немом шоке. Это же надо было додуматься снять такой детсадовский трейлер?  Судя по трейлеру фильма РЕАНИМАТОР сразу видно, в какую глубокую бездну пал российский кинематограф. Вообще создалось такое впечатление что пацаны вчера снимали свадьбы и корпоративчики, а сегодня так, от нечего делать, решили снять на камеру белиберду под названием «Трейлер фильма РЕАНИМАТОР»… Дальше в письме ребята хотели провести ICO на создание своего псевдо фантастического фильма и…Страшно подумать…Предлагали нам выступить организаторами их ICO за,  писаный вилами по воде, процент от прибыли после кинопроката. На этом моменте текста письма про ICO в нашем кабинете совещаний повисла 5-секундная пауза и очередной взрыв хохота! У этих дилетантов с улицы, о которых мы никогда нигде не слышали и не читали, даже не было никаких договорённостей с киноактерами или продюсерскими центрами, а они мечтают снять как пишут в письме- шедевр кино- фантастики! Допив утренний кофе и обсудив несколько задач на неделю мы благополучно забыли об этом чудном письме про какой-то странный, смешной и нелепый русский фильм РЕАНИМАТОР… Однако, через неделю мы получили второе письмо, уже лично от режиссера Руслана Магомадова кино-компании ЛАМ, в котором он сообщал что будет по делам в Таллине через 3 дня и что если у нас нашлось бы время поговорить с ним хотя бы 5 минут, то он был бы очень признателен. Почему бы и нет, подумали мы с ребятами? Будет еще один повод спустить  человека с небес на землю, указав всю абсурдность и неисполнимость его фильма путем живого диалога. На встрече через 3 дня, молодой и собранный молодой человек, Руслан Магомадов, почему-то сразу стал внушать к себе доверие. Каждая его мысль была строго аргументирована и обозначена ясно и четко. Это начинало удивлять…Первые несколько минут нашей встречи в офисе, сотрудники Янис и Мосс, пытались острить  над мыслями, трейлером и соображениями русского кинорежиссера.  Но с каждой минутой, чем дальше мы его слушали, тем реже и реже становились смешки в зале, до тех пор пока они вообще не прекратились. Разговор уже перешагнул через 5, 10, 30 минут и затем перешёл на другой уровень - серьёзный и конструктивный диалог. Во-первых, мы поняли, что это не трейлер, а тизер фильма. Тизер призван дать лишь черновое объяснение инвесторам (не кинозрителям!)  примерной сути будущего фильма. А трейлер монтируется только во время съемок самого фильма и на основе уже отснятых кадров. Во-вторых, в полном и детальном синопсисе, мы увидели, что фильм РЕАНИМАТОР не копия фильма ОБЛАСТИ ТЬМЫ. Мало того – это абсолютно разные две Вселенные сюжетной линии и вообще идеи фильма.  В фильме ОБЛАСТИ ТЬМЫ – писатель съев таблетку становится чуть ли не Эйнштейном 21 века. Но в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР –нет, совсем другая история. Главный герой здесь после инъекции сыворотки Омега, не превращается мгновенно в гения с феноменальной памятью. Нет. Он просто генетически изменившись, не может совершать ничего, что вредит его организму и получает абсолютную силу воли. Испытывает физическое отвращение ко всему, что вредит его телу и психике. Что бы это ни было – курение, наркотики, алкоголь, неправильное питание, лень и так далее. Убив изобретателя Омеги, его брата-ученого вместе с женой и детьми, на героя объявляют охоту крупнейшие международные фармацевтические компании мира, табачные, алкогольные корпорации и даже наркокартели.  Потому герой РЕАНИМАТОРА для них угроза номер один, из-за которого весь их бизнес может рухнуть за один день. Однако главный герой фильма, год за годом, постепенно изучая и постигая с помощью учебных пособий основы работы органов тела человека, тотально меняет себя. Постигает приемы гипноза. Занимается спортом и тренирует как мышцу свой мозг. Узнаёт секрет открытия второго дыхания. То есть – доводит за многие годы, свои тело и дух до максимального предела совершенства и тем самым, выходит на след всех палачей семьи родного брата для исполнения приговора- мести.   Еще одна проблема русского кино в том, что у нас перевернутая психология того, как делается фильм.  На Западе все начинается с зарождения оригинальной и интересной идеи. Под идею ищут сценариста, режиссёра, продюсера. Потом ищут подходящих актеров, потом пытаются понять, какой жанр из этого получается, под это делают бюджет и начинают снимать. У нас все наоборот. Люди решают сделать фильм. Первое, о чем они думают — это о кассовых сборах. Потом думают: «Чтобы заработать столько денег, какой жанр нужно снять?» Кажется, последний успешный фильм был комедией, значит, будет комедия. А какие актеры снимались последний раз в комедии? Ага, Светлаков  и Вера Брежнева, так. Теперь подумаем, чем они будут заниматься». То есть идея — это последнее в списке. Тем не менее, сегодня даже Голливудский ширпотреб киноиндустрии выдохся испытывая кризис оригинальных идей. В фильмах уже нет как раньше мощных, глубоких мыслей. Нужны фильмы, в основе которых будет необычная идея.  И мы увидели это в РЕАНИМАТОРЕ. В его сюжетной линии есть один большой краеугольный камень – очень сильная супер идея. В чем её суть? Она в том, что любой человек на Земле, как бы глубоко он ни пал на дно жизни, может таким же образом восстать из пепла, как это сделал по сценарию герой фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Современная молодёжь и подростки, которые сегодня привыкли или бессмысленно подражать всяким железным и не железным человечкам и паукам, или тупо наблюдать красивые спецэффекты в кино-фантастике, ничего не впитывает  в моральном аспекте после просмотра таких голливудских блокбастеров. Но в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР будет все иначе. Дети, подростки, молодёжь и  даже взрослые люди поймут, что все возможно в этой жизни. Стоит лишь захотеть. Стоит лишь собрать в кулак свою силу воли и все у тебя получится, что бы ты ни задумал. Надо только верить в себя и идти до конца. НЕ сдаваться. НЕ отчаиваться. Несмотря ни на что! Я предложил внести небольшие изменения и дополнения в сценарий фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Мы с Русланом пришли к единому мнению путем плодотворных споров к форме отточенности сюжетной линии. В конце концов я стал соавтором сценария будущего фильма. Затем мы обсудили с русским кинорежиссером его предыдущие кинопроекты.  Такие фильмы как ДОМ, Февраль, Пыль для матроса, Однажды в детском доме. Все эти фильмы завоевали первые места на престижных международных кинофестивалях в Европе и в США. Легко проверить достоверность загуглив названия фильмов с фамилией режиссера. Позже просматривая их, лично я заметил, что в каждом из них, несмотря на то что это художественные фильмы, создана уникальная атмосфера документального повествования и очень тонкий, но мощный авторский стиль  режиссера. Всматриваясь в экран, ты словно оказываешься в настоящем мире киноповествования и теряешь связь со своей реальностью, полностью погрузившись в созданный режиссером эффект личного присутствия.  Даже звуки внезапного порыва воздуха, хрустящего под ногами снега или дыхания героя, все продумано естественно и до мелочей. Посмотрите хотя бы один фильм ФЕВРАЛЬ Руслана Магомадова и вы поймёте о чём я говорю. Главные актеры играют в его фильмах настолько естественно и непринуждённо, что порой ловишь себя на мысли, а может это настоящие герои, а не актеры, испытавшие лично на себе все тяжести судьбы? Тем не менее идея проведения ICO для русского фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, нам продолжала тогда казаться нелепой и неуместной. А причем здесь фильм РЕАНИМАТОР и  блокчейн?!  На второй день, в центре Таллина, в уютном ресторане Чайковский, мы снова встретились с Русланом Магомадовым и несколько часов говорили на тему о том, ЧТО кроме кризиса идей испытывает сегодня вообще русский и мировой кинематограф.  Незаметно выяснилось, что есть сперва казалось бы небольшая, но на самом деле серьёзная проблема для хозяев кинофильмов. Многие сети кинотеатров, особенно в странах где развита коррупция, скрывают от владельцев фильмов часть полученной прибыли от продажи кино-билетов. Зафиксировать сколько продано кинотеатром кино-билетов на тот или иной фильм невозможно. Потому что система учета централизована. А что если попытаться поставить продажу всех билетов во всех кинотеатрах мира на блокчейн предложил я? Руслан тоже нашел это оригинальным и 100% способом обезопасить крупные кинокомпании от фальсификации кинотеатрами по суммам сборов от кинопроката. Сказано-сделано. Нам удалось получить предварительное согласие от сети 12 кинотеатров Швейцарии на пилотный прокат фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, внедрив у них временно для тестирования систему продажи кино-билетов на блокчейне CRYPTOMOVIE. Колоссальные прибыли от будущей продажи лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE трудно переоценить. Её потенциал можно сравнить лишь с потенциалом Windows версии 1.0.1 мало кому знакомой в далеком 1985году. Только за 2016 год, денежный оборот мировой киноиндустрии достиг свыше 800 миллиардов долларов США. А лицензия CRYPTOMOVIE будет обходиться владельцам кинокомпаний 2 % от суммы продаж. Через 5-8 лет — это будет около 16 миллиардов долларов США чистого дохода от международных продаж лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE …Для кинокомпаний купить такую лицензию лучше, чем терять 20-30% от продаж на фальсификациях. Кинотеатры также, в свою очередь, будут вынуждены подчиниться требованию кинокомпаний внедрить у себя технологию CRYPTOMOVIE, потому что иначе попросту не получат от кинокомпании права на прокат по своей сети кассового фильма.  Именно эти выводы стали для нашей компании решающим фактором, чтобы стать первым официальным инвестором фильма РЕАНИМАТОР и перевести транш инвестицию в созданию будущего культового фильма РЕАНИМАТОР = 1,6 миллиона USD. Успех или провал международного кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР лишь косвенно повлияет на внедрение главного смысла ICO REANIMATOR - технологии CRYPTOMOVIE.  В случае успеха – наши IT-разработчики смогут привлечь больше ресурсов и специалистов на ускоренную разработку программы, и менеджеры на мировой маркетинг и тестирование в кинотеатрах. В случае провала фильма РЕАНИМАТОР – мы просто потратим на год-два больше времени для внедрения в киноиндустрию технологии CRYPTOMOVIE. Так что начало даты старта продаж лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE для нашего хедж-фонда CRISSE лишь вопрос времени, независимо от результатов ICO REANIMATOR. Нами уже достигнуты предварительные договоренности с китайской компанией China Film Group о прокате и тестировании для CRYPTOMOVIE фильма РЕАНИМАТОР в Китае. Китай сегодня обогнал США по количеству кинотеатров – их свыше 41 тысяч (для сравнения в России – около 4000).  А Китай — это уже львиная доля доходов от кинопроката.",delete

"ЭСТОНЦЫ ИНВЕСТИРУЮТ В РУССКИЙ ФАНТАСТИЧЕСКИЙ ФИЛЬМ РЕАНИМАТОР: БЕЗУМНЫЙ ВЫЗОВ ГОЛЛИВУДУ ИЛИ ХОЛОДНЫЙ РАСЧЕТ ПОБЕДЫ?   Cвыше полутора миллиона долларов США, вложил в ICO российский фантастический фильм  РЕАНИМАТОР, Эстонский Хедж-фонд CRISSE.  По словам его руководства, это окупится в десятки раз.   И вот почему. Говорит, директор фонда, Алан Клаудис:  - В феврале 2017, это вложение в русский кинопроект, казалось всем нам чистым безумием. Потому что упадок и безликость русского кино вызывает отторжение и неприязнь у любых инвесторов. Однако у меня всегда была юношеская мечта испытывать гордость за великий киношедевр, о котором все с восторгом говорят, зная, что это и твоё детище.   Но я никогда не думал, что таким киношедевром сможет стать российский фильм. Позвольте мне вам объяснить:  1)   Во-первых, кинорежиссер Руслан Магомадов, всегда завоёвывает первые места за свои авторские фильмы на международных престижных кинофестивалях, с жёстким отбором. Но выйти за рамки авторского ему не позволяли финансы. 2)   Во-вторых, идея фильма РЕАНИМАТОР настолько красива и уникальна, что никогда ранее не была экранизирована или напечатана в СМИ. Она о том, любой человек может навсегда изменить свою жизнь и взойти на вершину Олимпа. Стоит лишь сильно захотеть и поверить в себя. 3)   В -третьих, в этот кинопроект вшита компьютерная технология CRYPTOMOVIE. Она исключает большую проблему для кинокомпаний-фальсификации по суммам сборов от кинопроката.  С помощью CRYPTOMOVIE инвесторы получат часть пирога от многомиллиардного мирового кинопроката всех фильмов. Это немалый кусок пирога -  минимум 16 миллиардов долларов ежегодно. Потенциал революционной CRYPTOMOVIE можно сравнить с потенциалом Windows 1985года. Удивительно, но ICO REANIMATOR это первый проект в криптомире, который позволяет инвестировать наличными на кассах более 10 тысяч супермаркетов и аптек.

Ведь государственные бюджетные  деньги возвращать не надо.  Вы абсолютно правы.  Проблема русского кино в том, что у нас перевернутая психология того, как делается фильм.  На Западе все начинается с зарождения оригинальной и интересной идеи. Под идею ищут сценариста, режиссёра, продюсера. Потом ищут подходящих актеров, потом пытаются понять, какой жанр из этого получается, под это делают бюджет и начинают снимать. У нас все наоборот. Люди решают сделать фильм.

"ПОЧЕМУ ДЛЯ КИНОПРОЕКТА РЕАНИМАТОР НУЖНЫ ТОКЕНЫ И ПРИЧЁМ ЗДЕСЬ БЛОКЧЕЙН?  Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР не привлечения инвестиций в бюджет фильма (хотя это тоже очень важно). Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР – создание ВПЕРВЫЕ В МИРЕ прозрачной сетки БЮДЖЕТА и ДОХОДА от кинопроката любых фильмов – компьютерной программы CRYPTOMOVIE.  Что это значит? После кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, 40% прибыли будет потрачено на создание специальной запатентованной технологии блокчейна – компьютерная программа CRYPTOMOVIE.  CRYPTOMOVIE позволит обезопасить создателей любых будущих кинопроектов (кинокомпании, студии и продюсерские центры) от махинаций и подтасовки результатов  суммы сборов от кинопроката любого фильма на международном рынке. Например, если на фильм АВАТАР Джеймса Кэмерона  официально  было продано билетов в мире на сумму свыше 700 миллионов долларов, то не официально эта сумма достигает свыше 1,5 миллиардов долларов. Почему? Потому что кинотеатры «прячут» 20-50% количества проданных билетов и доказать эту фальсификацию невозможно. Чтобы исключить махинации в этом  кинопрокатном секторе - все анонсы кинофильмов и заказы кинобилетов будут размещаться на сайте CRYPTOMOVIE. В результате все билеты на любой фильм, в любой стране и в любом кинотеатре будут напрямую выкупаться кинозрителями на сайте CRYPTOMOVIE.IO или с помощью мобильного приложения CRYPTOMOVIE за криптовалюту Waves или за фиатные деньги при помощи банковской карты или  электронных кошельков. В случае например онлайн-покупки кино-билета за фиатные деньги,  система CRYPTOMOVIE  автоматически трансформирует и отошлёт платёж в криптовалюте Waves на соответствующий каждому фильму свой уникальный кошелёк Waves, который периодически заводит в системе сеть кинотеатров после каждой премьеры нового фильма. Все данные таким образом, о количестве и цене проданных билетов оседают в блокчейне Waves. Далее, после выкупа кинозрителем билета в кино, эту информацию система  CRYPTOMOVIE. автоматически  передаёт по зашифрованному каналу в дата-центр соответствующего кинотеатра, где покупатель, в зависимости от его желания - или получает классический билет на бумажном носителе по первому запросу в кассе кинотеатра  при предъявлении QR-кода, выданном после онлайн-покупки билета или предъявляет этот QR-код контролёру со сканером  в момент входа в кино-зал. В том случае, если у зрителя нет возможности онлайн-оплаты билета, в холле любого кинотеатра будет размещён специальный мини-терминал по продаже кинобилетов за  криптовалюту Waves,  с использованием наличных фиат-денег. Терминалы онлайн-продажи кино-билетов во всех кинотеатрах будут размещать или сами кинотеатры или независимые владельцы за 0,5% вознаграждения от каждого выкупленного билета через их терминал. Итог: все данные о количестве выкупленных билетов на тот или иной фильм невозможно подделать так как хранятся на блокчейн-платформе Waves.  Таким образом, владельцев фильма невозможно обмануть, и они получают ровно столько денег от кинопроката, сколько было продано билетов (в соответствии с индивидуальными условиями процентного разделения доходов от продажи кино-билетов с каждой сетью кинотеатров). Фильм РЕАНИМАТОР выйдет в кинопрокат в декабре 2018 - в России, СНГ, Европе и Китае. Пилотная версия кинопроката РЕАНИМАТОР с использованием MVP формы продажи билетов по системе CRYPTOMOVIE выйдет в 12 кинотеатрах Швейцарии в мае 2019 года.    Лицензия технологии CRYPTOMOVIE для кинопроизводителей и сети кинотеатров,  по своему потенциалу прибыли равнозначна колоссальному успеху лицензии Windows  в 1986 году.",delete

"ТРИ ПРИЧИНЫ ПОЧЕМУ ICO REANIMATOR – НЕ АФЕРА И НЕ СКАМ    Потому что:  1)   В отличии от 99% современных ICO, кинопроект ICO REANIMATOR уже имеет MPV. Минимально жизнеспособный продукт (minimum viable product). Это – успешные художественные фильмы завоевавшие престижные награды на международных кинофестивалях США, Германии, Италии, Бразилии, Китае с 2005 по 2016 года: ФЕВРАЛЬ, ПЫЛЬ ДЛЯ МАТРОСА, ДОМ, ОДНАЖДЫ В ДЕТСКОМ ДОМЕ. Список наград и призов за эти фильмы можно детально увидеть по ссылке: -lam.com/blank 2)   Потому что авторы кинопроекта   всегда готовы к личным встречам и переговорам с инвесторами.  Контакты, адреса и номера телефонов указаны на официальном сайте кинокомпании: -lam.com/contact 3)   Потому что мы ценим свою репутацию. Никогда не было каких-либо проблем или судебных тяжб кого-либо из инвесторов с кинокомпанией ЛАМ. Это легко проверить в базе данных сделав официальный запрос на сайте Высшего Арбитражного суда РФ:   ",delete

Публично в открытом виде нигде ни  в одном ICO не афишируется такая информации, с фамилиями и со сканами паспортов  частных инвесторов.

"СВЕРХДОХОДЫ 300-600% ИНВЕСТОРАМ КИНОПРОЕКТА РЕАНИМАТОР: МИФ ИЛИ РЕАЛЬНОСТЬ?    Когда наша кинокоманда читает отзывы с критикой о безумно нами якобы завышенных процентах возможных доходов наших инвесторов это вызывает у нас по меньшей мере - улыбку. Сразу понятно что  авторы таких отзывов никогда не имели дело с кухней кинематографа, не понимают и не владеют абсолютно никакой информацией о том, какие многомиллиардные суммы  ""вертятся"" в мире кинобизнеса. Нас иногда хэйтят и  обвиняют в том, что это мол все у нас пирамида МММ, желание заработать на хайпе, бессмысленность затеи и вообще якобы НЕВОЗМОЖНО за год получить инвестору 300% дохода, если это не афера и не ""разводилово"". Давайте для начала  попробуем трезво мыслить, без негативных криков с пеной у рта  и смотреть в глаза строго голым общеизвестным  фактам о кино и фильмах в этом кино. А потом  уже будем делать  какие-то выводы. Окей? Итак. Начнём по порядку. Выгода инвесторов 300% дохода в год на самом деле это капля в море- то есть минимальное на что может инвестор рассчитывать от участия в кинопроекте ICO REANIMATOR. Зайдём для начала хотя бы на официальный сайт Википедии о сумме кассовых сборов (1-2 миллиарда долларов) самых рейтинговых фильмов. ..  %D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%85_%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2  Впечатляет не так-ли?

"   Да, хотелось бы увидеть как будут потрачены средства собранные в процессе ICO. И как писал автор некто выше, разумно будет снять продолжение фильма.",delete
"  Все АКТЕРЫ не будут говорить на английском.  Но фильм ориентирован на западного зрителя и большая часть съемок пройдет в США. Поэтому например  Козловского будут дублировать на  английском. Остальные  включая СТигала будут говорить на английском. Дело в том, что по официальной статистике 99% кассовых сборов приносят фильмы, где действие происходит на территории США. Это американцам ближе по сердцу. Но фильмы где действие происходит по большей мере вне пределов США не имеют больших кассовых сборов. Поэтому наша кинокоманда пошла на такой шаг: 80% - США, Остальные  геолокации по убыванию- Россия, Китай, Германия, Италия.",delete

"  Они - первые, ICO вроде бы еще никто не проводил. Краудфайндинг - был, но не  ICO. Еще сейчас вроде начнут ICO по сбору средств на документалку про Трампа, но опять таки- то документалка, а не художественный фильм.",delete
  Если говорить о полнометражном художественном фильме - то ICO REANIMATOR первое в мире.,delete
"В целом кино действительно является хорошей отраслью для получения иксов - здесь возможно при небольшом бюджете получить хорошие сборы. Остается только вопрос - как эти сборы обеспечить? Ведь иногда даже фильмы, признанные в последствии величайшими, сборов не обеспечивали, а иногда и вообще уходили в минус. Так что риск тут тоже большой.",delete
"   Безусловно риск большой, примеры фильмов которые приведены выше, являлись новой вехой в киноиндустрии. Почему бы Реиниматору, не оказаться таким же?",delete
"  Безусловно риск большой. Но такой же большой и выигрыш. Поэтому нужно разложить все факторы на составляющие  коммерческого успеха любого фильма: 1) Оригинальная идея 2) Съемки на территории США 3) Право проката в США и Китае Эти факторы есть в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР? Да,есть. И последнее: фактор риска инвестиций в ICO РЕАНИМАТОР в разы меньше фактора риска вложений в 99% современных ICO.",delete
"  Цель ICO это сбор средств на технологию криптомуви, если оно не состоится фильм все-равно будет снят, просто на сколько я понимаю, обкатать технологию хотели именно на этой картине.",delete
"   Конечно после всего этого очень неплохо посмотреть хороший фильм   Я не спец в сфере кинопроизводства, но этот проект имеет шанс на успех. Нужно только инвесторам подробно объяснить как получается прибыль от этого процесса.",delete
НЕИЗБЕЖНОСТЬ СТАРТА СЪЁМОК РЕАНИМАТОРА    Напоминаем всем инвесторам. Съемки фильма РЕАНИМАТОР пройдут в марте 2018  и мировой прокат осенью 2018 - в любом случае. Независимо от результатов ICO REANIMATOR.  We remind all investors. Shooting of the film REANIMATOR will be held in March 2018 and the world rolled in the autumn of 2018 - in any case. Regardless of the results of ICO REANIMATOR.,delete

"   Что вы говорите)) Вы уже в пролете из за выбора платформы))) Когда во многих ICO, я уже сделать 300-600% и это в бтс/eth еквиваленте, то все ICO которые проходили на этой платформе в диких минусах.",delete
"   Вы имеете ввиду волны, или какую платформу? Я всего то видел ровно 26 ICO проектов (по коинмаркету) которые принесли больше 100 процентов за все время проведения ICO (аж с 13 года).",delete
"    Помимо выбора платформы нужно еще учитывать идею и смотреть на способности команды. Сначала я тоже думал, что платформу не совсем хорошую выбрали, но они на мой взгляд не спецы в сфере криптовалюты и профит получат благодаря своему профессионализму в сфере кино.",delete

"   Если честно, то Сигал мне никогда не нравился и Козловский тоже особой симпатии не вызывает. Идея фильма интересная, но неплохо было бы поменять актерский состав. Многие просто не захотят смотреть и участвовать в проекте только из-за этих лиц которые раньше снимались в чем попало и ассоциируются с негативными воспоминаниями. Кино нужна свежая кровь.",delete
"    Обычно это в большей степени относиться не просто к выходцам из России, а именно к проектам географически привязанным к России. Если же это международная команда, то почему нет. Благо наши люди талантливы, так их и берут в другие проекты, примеров много.)  По сабжу, тут все обсуждают фильм, а как по мне, то это здесь не главное. Интересней гораздо, технология криптомуви.

"ПЕРВЫЕ ПОКУПАТЕЛИ ТЕХНОЛОГИИ CRYPTOMOVIE:   Сегодня утром  20 ноября 2017 года, мы стали абсолютно уверены в колоссальном будущем успехе нашей блокчейн технологии CRYPTOMOVIE! Руководство хедж-фонда CRISSE  достигло предварительных договорённостей с китайской госкорпорацией China Film Group Corporation (CFGC). Речь идёт о крайней заинтересованности China Film Group Corporation (CFGC) в покупке лицензии  БЛОКЧЕЙН ТЕХНОЛОГИИ CRYPTOMOVIE для внедрения в более чем 40 тысяч китайских кинотеатров (больше чем в США) в 2019 году.  Причина - большие проблемы в Китае по фальсификациям кассовых сборов, когда сети кинотеатров скрывают от кинокомпаний сумму выручки от продажи кинобилетов. Смотрите статью об этом в СМИ:    По статистике ежегодный оборот от продажи кинобилетов в этих кинотеатрах составляет свыше 8  миллиардов долларов США. Учитывая что стоимость лицензии БЛОКЧЕЙН ТЕХНОЛОГИИ CRYPTOMOVIE обойдётся заказчику 2 % от суммы с продажи кинобилетов, это составит примерно 160 миллионов долларов США в год. Минус амортизация и налоги = примерно 140 миллионов долларов США в год ЧИСТОЙ ПРИБЫЛИ.   30% от  чистой прибыли = 52 миллиона долларов США в год.  Вывод: ДЕРЖАТЕЛИ ТОКЕНОВ REANIMATOR (10 миллионов монет) ТОЛЬКО С одного КИТАЯ БУДУТ ИМЕТЬ 52 миллиона долларов США в год ПОЖИЗНЕННО.  P.S. Китай - это 10% мирового оборота кинопроката.",delete
"       Вообще Китайский рынок кинопроката оценивается по 2016 году на сумму около $5млрд. Но это так, уточнение. То, что он растет бешенными темпами это точно. Поэтому играть на Китай - верное решение. Но вы пишите, что есть предварительные договоренности по продаже лицензии блокчейн технологии., можно здесь по-подробней, что за лицензия? CRYPTOMOVIE это уже готвый продукт, MVP?",delete
"   1) 5 млрд USD - устаревшие данные. 2) Вы попали на страницу Анонса ICO REANIMATOR. Это и есть технология CRYPTOMOVIE в рамках данного ICO REANIMATOR. Осенью 2018 в мировой кинопрокат выйдет фантастический фильм РЕАНИМАТОР- пилотная версия которого будет тестировать блокчейн технологию CRYPTOMOVIE в 12 кинотеатрах Швейцарии.  Технология CRYPTOMOVIE - это специальная компьютерная онлайн-программа для сети кинотеатров, основанная на распределённом реестре хранения данных о количестве проданных кинобилетов кинотеатрами. Программа блокчейн технологии CRYPTOMOVIE призвана сделать прозрачной сетку Бокс-оффиса кассовых сборов сети кинотеатров. В результате кинокомпании будут получать всю сумму от кассовых сборов своих фильмов, без возможности фальсификации владельцами сети кинотеатров. Подробнее читайте Whitepaper ICO REANIMATOR:    3) Если бы сейчас был минимально жизнеспособный продукт (minimum viable product, MVP) - не было бы необходимости в проведении ICO REANIMATOR.

Технология CRYPTOMOVIE не только обезопасит кинокомпании от фальсификации кассовых сборов. Технология CRYPTOMOVIE  будет также использовать для взаиморасчетов и распределённого реестра хранения данных криптовалюту Waves, что  позволит значительно  повысить её капитализацию.  Совместная работа IT-специалистов Waves и CRISSE также ускорит старт продаж лицензии блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE  на мировом рынке киноиндустрии и соответственно  первые доходы 600-700% инвесторы смогут получить уже не в конце, а в  начале 2019 года.

"   Да не факт, может выстрелить и нонейм актеры. Для большинства молодых жителей до 25 лет планеты Земля имя Стивен Сигал как и Данила Козловский ни о чем не говорит.

"  Не знаю, как сейчас, но раньше в учебниках по режиссуре да и вообще по кино, всегда наиглавнейшая роль отводилась сценарию(драматургии), уже потом режиссеру, а потом оператору. Как сейчас - не знаю, но вряд ли законы и психофизиология зрительского восприятия как-то изменились с тех времен. Другой вопрос, что кино Реаниматор - чисто коммерческий проект, нацеленый на получение прибыли, и тут главное - затащить людей на просмотр, чтобы прокат вышел успешным, а тут наверное в большей степени  работает маркетинг и те факторы, которые представитель команды выше написал.",delete

Сейчас прошла новость про сжигание эфира, и на waves в таком случае начнут переходить многие проекты, поэтому все неоднозначно.",delete
"   Может услышат и решат заменить актеров на более современных) Вот инвестировать в такой интересный проект и потом смотреть на Сигала как-то рука не очень поднимается. Может эти актеры хорошо сохранились, но они уже как диско 80-х.",delete

"У меня вопрос по обратному выкупу токенов. В WP сказано, что минимальная цена выкупа 1 RNM= 6 USD (эквивалент в биткоинах и эфириуме) и максимальная – 10 USD. От чего зависит этот диапазон? Т.е. на основании каких исходных данных ваш фонд будет принимать решения, будет ли цены выкупа $6, а может $8 или $9? Здесь будут нужны объективные критерии, есть ли они у вас?",delete
"  20 ICO это уже много. Но в мире киноиндустрии такие проценты считаются минимальной нормой. Для жителей России, не раз обжигавшихся на всевозможных  финансовых пирамидах, к  таким процентам дохода, трудно привыкнуть.

"  В том то и дело, что Стивен Стигал идеально подходит по сценарию в фантастическом фильме РЕАНИМАТОР-  на роль старого, битого и жестокого  волка мафиози Майкла, по кличке Монгол. Так что от его кандидатуры команда кинопроекта РЕАНИМАТОР не откажется.",delete
  Верный вывод. Это зависит именно от прибыли  (30%) с  мировых кассовых сборов фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР.,delete
безполезная идея как по мне. За чем туда крипту и блокчейн тянуть. Снимайте за фиат и все),delete
   Насколько я прочел в WP и на сайте. После премьеры фильма токены будут выкупать по цене от 3 до 6 баксов за шт. В зависимости от кассовых сборов возможно) Вторая часть выкупа пройдет в декабре 2019 года по цене от 6 до 10 баксов за токен.,delete
"Чувствую со временем будут проводить ico по сбору денег на выпуск музыкальных альбомов, документальных передач, сериалов и т.д. От крипты не скроется никто. PS:  Инвестировать не буду, но с радостью посмотрю этот фильм",delete
  Вы немного ошиблись. Эта ветка не про ICO для сбора денег на съёмки фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Бюджет РЕАНИМАТОРА уже есть и фильм будет снят в марте-июне 2018 и выпущен в мировой кинопрокат в октябре 2018. Это ветка про ICO REANIMATOR сбора денег для создания блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE. Фильм РЕАНИМАТОР всего лишь приложение к  будущей блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE для тестирования в 12 кинотеатрах Швейцарии.,delete
"   Я понимаю, что от прибыли с кассы. Ну вот заработаете вы прибыли $10 000 000, то какая цена выкупа будет? А если, к примеру $1 000 000 или $100 000, то тогда какая? Есть ли объективные критерии? Ну а если прибыли будет условно $10 (утрирую), то, что тогда?",delete

"ВМЕСТЕ ИЛИ ПОРОЗНЬ?   В том случае, если платформа Waves. в лице её директора Александра Иванова откажется от сотрудничества с IT-подразделением хедж-фонда CRISSE, с целью совместной разработки блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE-это одновременно и плохо и хорошо. Плохо - потому что разработка блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE нами своими силами затянется до осени 2019. Хорошо - потому что тогда в одиночку мы заберём всю прибыль себе. То есть сможем вшить в технологию CRYPTOMOVIE не токены Waves, как это планировалось ранее, а токены REANIMATOR. В результате, мировой оборот онлайн-продажи кинобилетов в кинотеатрах, с начала 2020 года будет уже под контролем токенов REANIMATOR, а не токенов Waves.

Мне кажется тут логика должна такая быть: обеспеченный человек, который может заплатить за такие бонусы $1500 заплатит и в разы больше.

Это очень важный процесс и требует тщательного продуманного сценария, слаженной и синхронной работы всех людей кинопроекта: операторы, костюмеры, продюсеры, организаторы командировок в Китай, Германию,США и Италию и многие другие. Надо заранее заказать на пошив все костюмы и атрибуты для использования актерами в фильме. Нанять каскадеров и их командировку за рубеж.  Найти и оплатить работу проводников за рубежом в труднодоступных горных районах Китая. Договориться о бесперебойном  горячем питании и электропитании съемочной группы (аренда супер мощных генераторов) на местах. Сделать полную раскадровку 110 минут фильма по секундам и мили-секундам.

"УСПЕШНЫЙ КИНОПРОКАТ РЕАНИМАТОРА НЕИЗБЕЖЕН    Фантастический фильм РЕАНИМАТОР уже готовится к старту съёмок. Набрана профессиональная команда звукорежиссеров, операторов, монтажеров, костюмеров и продюсеров. Все мы увлечены идей сюжетной линии нашего фильма. Все абсолютно убеждены что фильм произведет фурор на мировом рынке кино. Почему? 1) Потому что у главной идеи фильма нет аналогов в истории кинематографа 2) Потому что большая часть съёмок пройдет в США 3) Потому что спецэеффекты создаст Лондонская студия ILM 4) Потому что мы будем делать тысячу дублей, чтобы добиться идеального кадра  Синопсис фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР:  Выросшие вместе с детства 2 брата Андрей и Данила совершенно разные по характеру и судъбе. Младший Данила после школы и армии ВДВ, стал алкоголиком от неразделенной любви и наркоманом. Старший Андрей закончил отлично МГУ и стал успешным биологом в Московском институте генетики. Андрей мечтая спасти жизнь брата создал сыворотку Омега, меняющую ДНК человека. В результате усиливается на 100% сила воли человека и появляется внутреннее отвращение ко всему, что вредит организму. Но Андрея убивают неизвестные и сжигают его в доме вместе с двумя маленькими детьми и женой. В убийстве Андрея полиция обвиняет младшего брата Данилу. Данила живующий на свалке на окраине Москвы вместе с кучкой бомжей и наркоманов получает от курьера ключ от ячейки банка. В банке он достаёт из ячейки новый паспорт с его фотографией, на чужие имя фамилию, шприц с Омегой и завещанием брата ввести инъекцию внутривенно. На второй день Данилу тошнит от вони, грязи и мусора. Он бросается в реку и начинает тщательно мыть все тело и одежду. Уходит со свалки. Начинает учить специальные книги в библиотеках. Находит работу грузчиком на заводе. Изучает на ютюбе кунгу-фу,бокс,айкидо,карате и самостоятельно тренируется на улице. Постигает успешно основы гипноза. Читает онлайн-книги в интернете  о способах тренировки мозга для улучшения памяти,  образного мышления и скорости реакции. Уезжает жить и работать в Китай, торговый город Гуанчжоу. Влюбляется в сотрудницу местной  библиотеки. Женится. Растит с супругой двух сыновей. Открывает крупный бизнес. Проходит 10 лет. Становится миллионером.  Тело и разум Данилы путём годов ежедневных многочасовых тренировок доведены до совершенства.  Чувство мести за жестокое убийство брата и его семьи тихо тлеет в его сердце. Заплатив тайно китайской лаборатории в НИИ, Данила получает через год - 4 порции сыворотки Омега. Возвращается в Москву. Даёт Омегу своим старым 4 знакомым: наркоманам и бомжам,тем самым реанимирует их. Вместе с новой командой улетает в США, Лас-Вегас. Там, находятся на недельном отдыхе все заказчики и банда исполнителя казни семьи брата...",delete
"МЫ ТОРГУЕМ ВЕРОЯТНОСТЬЮ    Команду ICO REANIMATOR иногда упрекают в том, что мы якобы слишком самоуверены.  Что мол, нельзя быть настолько убеждёнными в том, что  токены REANIMATOR осенью 2018 будут стоить  на бирже Dex Waves в 3-4 раза дороже чем сегодня. Мы согласны с этими доводами наших критиков. Но лишь частично. И вот почему: Есть ли вероятность того, что токены REANIMATOR осенью 2018 будут стоить  на бирже Dex Waves в 3-4 раза дороже чем сегодня? Да есть. А есть ли вероятность что не будут? Да, тоже есть. Но насколько первая вероятность перевешивает вторую? Вот в чём главный вопрос.  Почему первое намного вероятнее второго? Потому что: Кинокомпания ЛАМ на рынке киноиндустрии с 2005 года. До сих пор наши художественные фильмы находили отклик в сердцах кинозрителей и завоёвывали первые места на престижных международных кинофестивалях  с жестким отбором. Так почему же  на этот раз этого не произойдёт с фантастическим фильмом РЕАНИМАТОР?  Почему вдруг этот фильм должен стать (как считают одни скептики) провальным? Потому что скептики привыкли быть пессимистами к возможности успеха русского кино?  Или потому что скептики не верят в профессионализм кинокоманды фильма РЕАНИМАТОР? Наверное и то и другое. И это - единственные 2 довода скептиков. Однако наших доводов больше. Мы, все 47 членов кинокомпанды фильма РЕАНИМАТОР уверены в одном. Что мы будем отдавать все свои силы, душb и сердца  ради великолепного фильма с потрясающей супер-идеей и спецэффектами.  Мы вложим в наше детище все наши знания, моральные и физические способности до последней капли силы воли. В этом мы уверены на 100%. А что касается нашего заявления на ICO REANIMATOR  о том, что кассовые сборы фильма РЕАНИМАТОР окупят бюджет 10-кратно - это  не абсолютная гарантия. Такую гарантию не может дать в этом мире никто, кроме Бога.   Это - вероятность.  Чрезвычайно высокая вероятность. Поэтому мы- торгуем вероятностью.",delete

"ВСЕ ЧТО НЕ ДЕЛАЕТСЯ-  К ЛУЧШЕМУ!   Прошло 5 дней. Но мы не получили ответа от руководства платформы Waves по поводу нашего делового предложения о сотрудничестве. Речь идёт о возможности совместной разработки IT-специалистами блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE раньше намеченного по дорожной карте срокам.  То есть не в 2019, а в уже в 2018 году. Учитывая полную тишину в ответ, руководство хедж-фонда CRISSE cдопускает вероятность самостоятельной разработки и  внедрения блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE, без участия программистов платформы Waves. В случае самостоятельной разработки нами блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE мы интегрируем в систему  онлайн-покупку кинобилетов не за токены Waves. как это планировалось ранее, а за токены  REANIMATOR.  В результате все  доходы от первой продажи лицензии в  кинотеатры КНР будут на 100% принадлежать хедж-фонду CRISSE.

"   По мне так интересный сюжет! Хотя вы и отбиваетесь всеми силами от сюжетного сходства с некоторыми Голивудскими фильмами, но все же некоторое сходство есть) Но кто сказал, что это плохо? Использовать долю успешной у аудитории темы, по-моему вполне нормально. Вы же не копируете полностью, а лишь больше развиваете мысль, да и изобрести велосипед в реалиях сегодняшнего кино, где всё про всех уже снято - достаточно трудно.

"   Концовка - это настоящая интрига. Она настолько  непредсказуема, что станет шоком для всей аудитории кинозрителей фильма. Именно в последних 5 минутах фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР и будет заложен весь его смысл и супер-идея.",delete

"В WP у вас мало внимания уделено юридической структуре проведения ICO. Есть ли у вас SPV? И как вы будете переводить в фиат, собранные средства?",delete
"  1) Каких именно моментов юридической структуры на Ваш взгляд  не хватает в нашем WP? 2) SVP-компания специального назначения нам не нужна. Потому что реализацией кинопроекта займется  кинокомпания ЛАМ, а реализацией технологии CRYPTOMOVIE займется IT-подразделение хедж-фонда CRISSE. 3) Собранные средства сегодня 2,6 миллиона USD уже находятся в фиате. Поэтому бюджет для фильма РЕАНИМАТОР существует уже в фиате. Другие дополнительные средства в криптовалюте необходимо лишь для создания технологии CRYPTOMOVIE.   Но для  создания технологии CRYPTOMOVIE  не нужен фиат. Потому что по договору все выплаты заработной платы программистам, инженерам,маркетинг и оплата услуг поставщиков спецоборудования для блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE будут производиться в криптовалюте.",delete

В том случае, если больше не соберем денег на платформе Waves- перейдем в январе 2018, на вторую фазу ICO REANIMATOR, но уже на платформе Ethereum. В любом  случае - холдеры токенов REANIMATOR на платформе Waves будут вознаграждены от суммы кассовых сборов в размере 30%. 2) 70 % ОТ КИНОПРОКАТА РЕАНИМАТОРА осенью 2018 будут потрачены на разработку технологии CRYPTOMOVIE 3) Минимальный набор инвестиций = 2 миллиона USD",delete
Думаю выбор платформы Waves был не самых лучшим решением. Сразу надо было проводить ICO на эфириуме.,delete

По всем законам рыночной экономики, там где есть спрос, но нет предложения-возникает незаполненная ниша. Именно блокчейн-технология CRYPTOMOVIE и заполнит эту пустоту своим уникальным предложением в мире киноиндустрии. Даже не будет особой необходимости в большом маркетинге рекламной кампании.

Учитывая что по условиям переговоров хедж-фонда CRISSE с госкорпорацией China Film Group Corporation, лицензия обходится заказчику в 2% от цены кинобилета, это также составит 2% от всех кассовых сборов в Поднебесной. Для сравнения - в 2015 году кассовые сборы в Китае составили по официальной статистике - 7 миллиардов долларов США:  -kitay-site-anons.html  Даже если предположить что кассовые сборы в Китае 2019 будут катастрофически меньше чем в 2015 году= например 5 миллиардов долларов США, то доход от продажи лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE в 2019 году составит: 2% от 5.000.000.000 = 100 миллионов USD.

Вердикт: Просим пожалуйста не путать съемки фильма РЕАНИМАТОР с созданием блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE.",delete
"  Если этот факт правда то инвесторам стоит зацепиться за это, очень сильный момент. В Китае со сборами вообще какая то каша и не удивительно, что подобная технология их интересует.",delete
"интересный проект, что-то новенькое, удачи вам",delete
"    хм. Смотрите. Почему тогда вы не назвали свой проект Cryptomovie? На ГЛАВНОЙ странице ОФИЦИАЛЬНОГО сайта проекта  нет ни одного слова про систему криптомуви. Далее, идем в БЕЛУЮ БУМАГУ про криптомуви, да, написано, но придется прочитать сначала про очень замечательный фильм. Отсюда следует вопрос, если Вы ставите основной целью сбор средств на систему криптомуви, почему не указываете это на официальном сайте и не пишете на первых страницах белой бумаги? Затем, смотрим, вы заявляете что фильм будет с бюджетом в 10кк, заходим на сайт и видим сумму сборов, в ""зеленой зоне"" сумма в 10кк. Совпадение? Вы же говорите что бюджет собран. Мне как юзеру с опытом не составило труда усомниться и со всем ознакомиться, в итоге, я ничего не понял. Отсюда следует, как поймет суть целевой инвестор?",delete
"Из белой бумаги проекта ICO REANIMATOR ТЕКУЩИЙ СТАТУС Российская кинокомпания ЛАМ с 10-летним опытом производства художественных фильмов, по заказу эстонского хедж-фонда CRISSE, займётся полным циклом производства фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. В настоящее время ICO REANIMATOR находится в стадии формирования бюджета в размере 10 миллионов USD. Эстонский хедж-фонд CRISSE к 1 сентября 2017 уже перевёл 14% бюджета, из собственных оборотных средств, для кинокомпании ЛАМ в размере 1,6 миллиона USD, на подготовку к съёмкам фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Оставшиеся и необходимые дополнительно 8,4 миллиона USD планируется собрать в ходе Pre-ICO и ICO фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. На эту сумму будут оплачены контракты с популярными киноактерами Данила Козловский, Стивен Сигал и другие. Оплачены командировки в США, Китай, Италию, массовки, питание, проживание киногруппы, аренда специального оборудования для съёмок (смотрите вложение файл БЮДЖЕТ производства фильма REANIMATOR ), производство копий для показа в кинотеатрах и маркетинговые кампании после постпродакшн. Противоречия...",delete
"Затем вы в той же белой бумаге пишите. Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР не привлечения инвестиций в бюджет фильма (хотя это тоже очень важно). Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР – создание ВПЕРВЫЕ В МИРЕ прозрачной сетки БЮДЖЕТА и ДОХОДА от кинопроката любых фильмов – компьютерной программы CRYPTOMOVIE. Что это значит? После кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, 40% прибыли будет потрачено на создание специальной запатентованной технологии блокчейна – компьютерная программа CRYPTOMOVIE. CRYPTOMOVIE позволит обезопасить создателей любых будущих кинопроектов (кинокомпании, студии и продюсерские центры) от махинаций и подтасовки результатов суммы сборов от кинопроката любого фильма на международном рынке. Я окончательно запутался) Объясните.",delete
"   Если Козловский еще может привлечь большую часть женской аудитории, то Сигал уже никому не интересен. Я уже писала в ветке баунти, что внимание намного лучше бы привлекло участие Киану Ривза. Он интересен как женской так и мужской аудитории + молодо выглядит + фильмы с его участием можно пересматривать не один раз, одно его имя уже вызывает интерес к проекту... но гонорар наверное захочет большой или может наоборот согласится помочь развиваться киноиндустрии.",delete
"   Фанаты Сигала уже выросли и сейчас как раз являются в возрасте инвестора, это целевая группа. А фанаты Киану Ривза малы ещё для серьёзных инвестиций.)",delete
   А фанаты Козловского еще в пеленках В первую очередь нужно ориентироваться на зрителей. Нужны свежие лица или те кто сможет сделать фильм культовым. Я бы вообще предоставила возможность народу предлагать актеров на которых они хотят смотреть.,delete
"  Идея конечно с выбором актёров интересная, но как её реализовать?",delete
"  Реализовать то не сложно, я думаю. Например через голосование на сайте, с ценой голоса в зависимости от вклада инвестора. Просто вопрос в дургом - фильм то не инвесторам показывать будут, а зрителям, поэтому актеров должны профессионалы кастинга выбирать, плюс режиссер - тогда у фильма успех будет.",delete
"Вот дела, невнимательно изучал проект и недоглядел, что сборы идут на создание платформы, а фильм как тест. С Китаем сотрудничество - это хорошо, но инвестиции от них наврятли будут, так как у них сейчас запрет на инвестирование в ико. А Козловский с Сигалом должны хоть немного привлечь аудиторию имхо) Удачи проекту вообщем, буду дальше наблюдать за вашим проектом.",delete
   Совершенно верно. Китай не инвестирует в ICO. Это запрещено местными законами. Поэтому Китай (в лице China group film) покупает у хедж-фонда CRISSE в 2019 - запатентованную лицензию на технологию CRYPTOMOVIE.,delete
"  Имеется в виду что 40% прибыли с кассовых сборов фильма РЕАНИМАТОР , будет потрачено  на тщательную разработку блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE и её тестирование в 16 кинотеатрах ЕС для первой продажи в Китай .",delete
"  Ну разговор и был как раз о том чтобы предоставлять именно зрителям выбирать актёров, вот меня и заинтересовало как это можно реализовать.",delete
"   Это очевидно, но про бюджет фильма интересно.",delete
"   Здесь уже нужно новое ICO запускать Идея с платным голосованием очень хорошая. Зрители таким образом могут помочь не только выбрать актера, но и сделать небольшую инвестицию в проект, а режиссер будет уже выбирать среди тех за кого больше проголосовали.",delete
"  И самое главное, что голосование невозможно будет подтасовать, ведь оно будет на блокчейне. Действительно это очень хорошая идея для ИКО.",delete
WTF ?))) Никто не замечает что ли что представители сами путаются что они хотят от ico или всем тупо нсрть и лишь бы за баунти мелочуги накинули?),delete
  В чем именно по Вашему путаются представители? Объясните пожалуйста по конкретней свою мысль.,delete
"  Я указал все выше. Я не понимаю про бюджет фильма. Он собран? Если да, то почему в белой бумаге сказано что именно с денег на ico, будут оплачиваться актеры и так далее. Далее. Почему на главной странице вашего сайта нет ни слова про криптомуви? Ведь это главная идея проекта. Да и зачем тогда тратить 40% от сборов фильма, если можно уже после ico разрабатывать криптомуви. Вот это непонятно, меня личнo ввело в заблуждение. С уважением bizfyn.",delete
"  Да, эту идею можно реализовать, причем реализация как мне кажется - довольно элементарная, причем действительно здравой мыслью будет сделать вес голоса зависимым от объема инвестиций. Но в этой идее есть несколько больших НО - во-первых я уже написал, что зритель не видит всех нюансов работы над фильмом, в отличии от например продюсера, и не может до конца понимать - почему этот актер подходит или не подходит на роль. При этом кино все таки снимается коммерческое в большинстве своем, и там действуют свои законы, там главное сборы, а не хотелки десятка инвесторов, а потенциальный успех сборов может оценить только грамотный продюсер. Вторая причина - крипта слишком молода, и не вошла плотно в нашу жизнь, поэтому ""киношников"" вряд ли интересуют инвестиции в крипте, по крайней мере в масштабах голливуда.",delete
"  Смысл не в том чтобы инвесторы выбирали,  а чтобы выбирал зритель. Например, хочет зритель видеть определённого актёра в определённом в фильме, идёт и голосует за этого актёра, оплачивая например взнос стоимости билета на этот фильм за возможность проголосовать, а после съёмок имеет право на один бесплатный поход в кинотеатр на этот фильм, как то так.",delete
"    Уважаемый Киану - топовый актер, обладатель самого большго гонорара в истории кино, и в среднем его гонорараы выше, чем весь предполагаемый бюджет фильма реаниматор. Вот тут проблемка, так что давайте быть реалистами. С ним фильм, конечно, очень выигрышно смотрелся бы ",delete
"    Если быть реалистами, то Сигал не вписывается на главную роль в этот фильм и не сделает его культовым. Не обязательно же заменять актера на Киану чтобы добиться успеха, можно рассмотреть более бюджетные варианты.",delete
  Так у него не главная роль вроде или я чего то не понял?,delete
"   В описании же указано, что на главные роли планируют пригласить Сигала и Козловского, а все остальные будут эпизодические и массовка.",delete
"  Я просто где то читал вроде у него роль босса мафии в фильме, а для этой роли он в самый раз сейчас.)",delete
"  Правильно. Именно с денег на ico, будут оплачиваться актеры и так далее. А как иначе? Ведь бюджет собран благодаря ICO.",delete
"ICO REANIMATOR переходит на платформу ETHEREUM    В январе 2018, ICO REANIMATOR начинает вторую и последнюю фазу краудсейла, но уже на платформе ETHEREUM. Доводим до сведения всех потенциальных инвесторов следующую информацию: 1) Будет выпущено лимитированно 5 миллионов токенов REANIMATOR на Ethereum 2) Токен REANIMATOR на ERC-20 будет стоить 2 USD  P.S. Не проданные токены REANIMATOR будут сожжены. Все владельцы токенов REANIMATOR на платформе Waves продолжат оставаться полноправными инвесторами и получат 30% прибыли с кассовых сборов в 2018, а также  30% с продажи лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE в Китай в 2019",delete
"  Не нашёл дат в дорожной карте, поясните?",delete
"   Да, но босс мафии должен быть таким чтобы зрителям и инвесторам не жалко было вкладывать свои деньги. Я вот думаю, что может даже Аль Пачино все равно будет лучше чем Сигал. Сколько режиссеров, столько и мнений",delete
"  Не ну Аль Пачино конечно, это совсем другой уровень.) Хорошо что не нам выбирать, а то сложно было бы прийти к консенсусу.)",delete

Всем привет! В свете новой новости о втором раунде ICO хотелось бы узнать будет ли там тоже - баунти программа. А также не повлияет ли второй раунд на выход токенов на биржу с первого раунда ICO. ,delete
"   1) Да,будет. 2) Нет не повлияет.",delete
"Когда на сайте появится информация о второй фазе ICO? Подписи будете менять, а то эти уже будут неактуальны?",delete
ДО ЗАВЕРШЕНИЯ ICO осталось меньше 7 дней.,delete
"   Да к нашим проектам мало доверия, и не только у иностранцев, а и нас самих. Но ниче, присмотреться есть к чему",delete
"    Это просто супер! Обязательно буду участвовать и во втором раунде! Я уверен, что во втором раунде будет намного больше инвесторов и участников баунти. Спасибо команде Reanimator за такую возможность.",delete
  Ну тут скорее интернациональный проект.,delete
   В январе 2018 - на сайте появится информация о второй фазе ICO.,delete
"ВСЕ СИЛЫ НА CRYPTOMOVIE    Команда ICO REANIMATOR будет больше половины своих ресурсов и технических возможностей  вкладывать в создание и внедрение в мировой кинопрокат нашей запатентованной блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE. Съёмки, постпродакшн и прокат фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР также будет идти на высоком и профессиональном уровне. Однако наибольший потенциал по нашему мнению лежит именно в блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE. В предыдущих постах мы уже сделали точный расчет прибыли с продаж нашей блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE для китайской госкорпорации China group film - 2 % с ежегодного оборота кассовых сборов в Китае (около 3 миллиардов USD).  P.S. Блокчейн-технология CRYPTOMOVIE будет куплена китайской госкорпорацией China group film на базе тестового проката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР в 16 кинотеатрах  ЕС.",delete
"  Это хорошо, значит будем следить за новостями.",delete
"  Да, действительно хорошая новость, я бы хотел поучаствовать в баунти этого проекта, если оно будет во время второго этапа ICO, потому-что считаю, что проект очень перспективный, и прибыль принести способен.",delete
  А как первый этап исо? Собрали необходимую сумму? Где посмотреть на сборы,delete
"  Первый этап еще идет, и будет продолжаться 5 дней - до 15 декабря. Собрали на текущий момент  2 673 249 долларов, с 249 инвесторов. Так как ICO проводят на волнах - как проверить реальную сумму сборов - не знаю",delete
  Если это реальные суммы сборов то то очень даже неплохая сумма. Не всякий англоязычный проект может похвастать тем что удается собирать такие цифры и тем-более на не завершенном первом этапе финансирования.,delete
  На главной проекта в режиме онлайн.,delete
"   Это с учетом ранних инвесторов, которые внесли в проект 2.6 миллиона долларов или это сумма собрана непосредственно на исо?",delete
"  А фиг его знает - на сайте висит дата 22.03.2017, и Всего собрано: 2 673 249 $, видимо с учетом ранних инвесторов, если они были. Тут вам лучше ответит представитель команды, потому что я такой информации не встречал в ветке.",delete
   А как то можно посмотреть откуда собраны были 2673249? Они были вложены через блокчейн транзы или фиатом?,delete
  Что за ранние инвесторы можно по подробнее?,delete
  2 673 249 $ на ICO REANIMATOR были собраны: 1) Март 2017 - Межбанковский трансфер  от хедж-фонда CRISSE 2) Покупка токенов REANIMATOR наличными на кассах супермаркетов в Германии на стадии Pre-ICO и  ICO.,delete
"Блокчейн используется всё больше и больше в разных направлениях и использование его в кинематографе это ещё один плюс и видимость,как прогрессирует технология.",delete
СКОРО ПОЙДЁМ НА ВЗЛЕТ: ПРИСТЕГНИТЕ РЕМНИ!    Осталось всего 3 дня до завершения ICO REANIMATOR. Все самое лучшее в будущих технологиях киноиндустрии: блокчейн-технология  CRYPTOMOVIE и пилотный прокат фильма РЕАНИМАТОР на CRYPTOMOVIE. 30% от прибыли с кассовых сборов - инвесторам ICO REANIMATOR. 2 % с  мировых продаж блокчейн-технология  CRYPTOMOVIE. Последняя цена токенов REANIMATOR  = 1 USD на платформе Waves. Цена на завершающей стадии на платформе ETHEREUM будет уже в 2 раза выше = 2 USD. Не опоздайте на посадку в самолет ICO REANIMATOR.

"Совсем мало осталось времени до окончания ИКО на волнах с бонусами, а вроде недавно всё начиналось только.)",delete
"  Возможно рано ещё об этом говорить, уже после окончания первого этапа скорее всего.",delete
   Главные  актеры в фильме  РЕАНИМАТОР уже  определены. Это Данила Козловский и Стивен Сигал. Многие инвесторы просят нас взять вместо Козловского -Киану Ривза. Мы напишем ему письмо с таким предложением. Также перешлем ему синопсис через его агента. Однако если цена вопроса будет слишком высока- мы откажемся от этого варианта.,delete
"БЛОКЧЕЙН-ТЕХНОЛОГИЯ CRYPTOMOVIE НА ЧЕТЫРЁХ КИТАХ КИТАЯ    Хедж-фонда CRISSE и госкорпорация CHINA FILM GROUP, в рамках предыдущих предварительных переговоров, пришли к новому соглашению. После успешного тестового проката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР на блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE в 16 кинотеатрах Европы в 2018 году,  будет второй и последний тест драйв CRYPTOMOVIE в кинотеатрах четырёх крупных городов Китая: Шанхай, Пекин, Гонконг и Чэнду.    Тест стартует по плану весной 2019 и продлится 2 месяца. В случае его успешного прохождения, госкорпорация CHINA FILM GROUP, выкупает у хедж-фонда CRISSE лицензию блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE сроком на 5 лет для внедрения в 40 с лишним тысяч кинотеатров Китая. Условия лицензии: 2% от кассовых сборов всех фильмов в Китае получает хедж-фонд CRISSE. Учитывая кассовые сборы порядка 10 миллиардов USD, это составит  около 200 миллионов USD. Владельцы токенов REANIMATOR  получают в рамках дорожной карты соответственно 30% от прибыли, то есть около 60 миллионов USD.  60 миллионов USD будут равномерно распределены между  всеми холдерами токенов REANIMATOR.

   Значит все-таки люди готовы инвестировать в фильм где будет Киану пусть даже вместо Козловского Если захочет слишком высокую цену придется потом писать продолжение сценария или создавать новый фильм и увеличивать сумму сборов.,delete
  Возможно пусть те инвесторы кто хочет Ривза и формируют бюджет под него.),delete
НАЧАЛО ТОРГОВ ТОКЕНОВ REANIMATOR НА БИРЖЕ    Напоминаем всем владельцам токенов REANIMATOR. С 16 декабря 17:00 по Москве токены REANIMATOR будут доступны для торговли на децентрализованной бирже Dex Waves. Начальная цена торгов - 1 USD.,delete
"На сколько я понимаю, владельцы токенов REANIMATOR обеих платформ (Waves и ETHEREUM) получат 30% прибыли с кассовых сборов в 2018, а также  30% с продажи лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE в Китай в 2019. Так?",delete
"Да, вроде бы токены с разных этапов имеют одну значимость.",delete
"   Посмотрим, как закончится первый раунд. Но предположить можно, что во втором раунде будет намного больше инвесторов и участников баунти. Тем более, что цена токена Reanimator будет в два раза дороже. ",delete

"[/quote]  Интересно, что у вас выйдет, сам актер Козловский меня заинтересовал, люблю фильмы где он снимается. Уже думаю будет успешным проект. С большим удовольствием бы сходила просмотр. Думаю проект должен быть бомбой. Но ребята вам нужно обязательно хорошенько постараться. У же в первом раунде не успеваю принять участие, думаю во втором обязательно постараюсь принять участие. Уж заинтересовали свои проектом. Думаю и инвесторы у вас будут хорошие. Только не снимайте ""мыльные драмы"", уже достали. Уровень снятия фильмов и идеи очень страдает.

"  Вы ведь сами написали, сейчас по $1, а будут по $2.",delete
"Киану Ривз и Данила Козловский....что же в них общего? Возрастные группы-нет, типаж-нуу нет, гонорары-вообще промолчу не терпится посмотреть на героя фильма, под которого выбирают одного из этих претендентов и да, когда же появятся в кинематографе сюжеты с криптой?)",delete
  В фильме РЕАНИМАТОР конечно будет упомянута крипта. В частности - встреча главного героя  в Лас-Вегасе  с основателем биткоина- Сатоши Накамото.,delete
   А для чего в них должно быть что-то общее?,delete
"  все отлично, и задумка и сюжет. скажите когда будут начаты съемки, приблизительное время выхода фильма на публику?",delete
"Получается попробовать себя частичкой продюсера, было бы хорошо что бы не одного этого фильма касалось ico, предоставить возможность владельцам токенов голосовать за новые проекты для съёмок.",delete
"  Сейчас криптовалюту можна инвестировать везде. И в недвижимость, нанотехнологии. А почему б не киноматограф?",delete
   Это хорошая идея. Но причем здесь токены проекта Реаниматор?,delete
"  В следующем этапе будет по $2, поэтому сейчас получается со скидкой.",delete
"  Да, всем присматривающимся к проекту, и раздувающим над вложением, советовал бы сделать это именно сейчас - когда есть возможность купить дешевле. Проект выглядит очень достойным и перспективным, возможно единственное достойное ИКО на волнах за последнее время.",delete

"   Сегодня не одно ICO в мире не выдаёт своим инвесторам в своем офисе при физическом контакте -  банковскую гарантию или какой-либо официальный документ с подписями и печатями руководства ICO. И это нормально. Потому что, ICO - это высокорисковые инвестиции и  соответственно фантастически высокомаржинальные прибыли. Также, в принципе, как и венчурные фонды мировые. На венчурных фондах инвесторы также рискуют и подписывают бумаги что осознают степени риска. Так что, как Вы правильно заметили, абсолютно все ICO сегодня реализуют свои токены только под честное слово и токены которые могут не взлететь. Это так.  Мы не отличаемся в этом плане от остальных.  P.S. Кто рискует многим - получит  много. Кто рискует малым - получит мало.",delete

"  Не соглашусь - все таки стартапы в IT секторе показывают намного лусшие результаты, и все проекты, которые давали и дают хорошие иксы - из сферы IT как раз таки. И cryptomovie это тоже it продукт а не завод или карьер. А фильм - это только для стартового капитала.",delete
"  Я говорил о виртуальном секторе, к примеру, монетизация вай фай соединения, платформы для торговли и аренды недвижимости, те проекты где нет реального продукта, к которому применяется блокчейн. Они почти всё со старта идут ко дну. А здесь есть реальный продукт - кинематограф, к которому применяется блокчейн. Люди платят за просмотр, организаторы имеют процент с реального оборота денег.",delete
  Подготовка к съемкам фильма РЕАНИМАТОР уже активно прошла с марта 2017 по ноябрь 2017.,delete
"  Может конечно они и идут ко дну в большинстве своем, но именно проекты из этой сферы дали инвесторам большие иксы. Но реаниматор - продукт особенный, он не относится к сфере реального производства, ибо кино - это не производство, а развлечения, и у успешного фильма(а фильм должен получиться успешным, судя по стараниям команды) есть все шансы собрать кассу.",delete

"СТАРТ ICO REANIMATOR НА ПЛАТФОРМЕ ЭФИРИУМА 26 ФЕВРАЛЯ 2018    Уважаемые инвесторы на платформе Waves и потенциальные инвесторы, а также читатели нашей ветки ICO REANIMATOR. Мы объявляем официальную дату начала ICO REANIMATOR на платформе Эфириума - 26 февраля 2018. Будет выпущено на краудсейле 10 миллионов монет на протоколе ERC-20. Будут большие бонусы и скидки инвесторам в первую и вторые недели краудсейла. Более точные данные  и обновленная дорожная карта будут объявлены до конца января 2018  на этой ветке и на сайте   P.S. После кассовых сборов тестового фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, и пилотного проката фильма в европейских кинотеатрах - первая лицензия блокчейн технологии CRYPTOMOVIE будет куплена китайской госкорпорацией China Film Group.

"Вы вроде фильм собирались снимать, а теперь кинопрокат? Концепция поменялась? Я с нетерпением жду фильма если что..",delete
    Интересно или это дествительно правда. А то я не верю в этот проект. Но вот сейчас задумалась уже.,delete
"   Правда что именно? Токены добавить на эти две биржи особого труда ведь не составляет, а вот о качетстве веры в этот проект легко скажет его трейлер и там мягко говоря все очень кустарно как для кино и даже телемыла и тем более ютуба с его дудём и блоггерами",delete
"   Фильм РЕАНИМАТОР снимается в любом случае.  Независимо от ICO REANIMATOR. Это как взлёт пассажирского самолета. Он взлетит независимо от того, успеете Вы лично на его рейс или не успеете. Просто если успеете- то полет вместе с вами будет более приятным для всех пассажиров. ВОТ И ВСЯ РАЗНИЦА.",delete
"   1) Токены добавить на эти биржи, да не трудно как Вы заметили. В том случае если у вас есть жизнеспособный MPV и 2 Биткоина. 2) О каком  трейлере фильма РЕАНИМАТОР Вы говорите? Трейлер любого фильма всегда монтируется только после завершения всех съёмок  и только строго на основе уже отснятых кадров. А съёмки фильма РЕАНИМАТОР   стартовали всего лишь месяц назад и продлятся до конца мая. Нет нигде и быть не может трейлера фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Может Вы с кем-то путаете нас?",delete
"   а почему полет вместо со мной должен обязательно быть приятным для пассажиров? так бывает только в тех случаях, если я работаю стриптизершей, а не потный толстый мужик с вонючими носками",delete
  Очень просто. Потому что вы инвестор. А команда ICO в лице остальных инвесторов уважает и ценит своих клиентов.,delete
"Какая бредовая идея, и сюжет затертый. Пришло же в голову снять такое. У проекта нет будущего. По мне так, есть масса куда более интересных и актуальных проектов.",delete
"  Сюжет не затёртый. Потому что никогда раньше в кино не было ни одного сюжета, похожего на сюжет фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Это во первых. А во вторых ICO REANIMATOR это не попытка собрать бюджет на производство фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Цель ICO REANIMATOR- это создание запатентованной блокчейн-технологии CRYPTOMOVIE, по заказу Китайской госкорпорации China Film Group. Фильм РЕАНИМАТОР призван лишь протестировать на себе бета-версию CRYPTOMOVIE в 12 кинотеатрах Евросоюза.

Имеют в планах пригласить во всей видимости на главные роли Стивена Сигал и Данила Козловского, то же смешно. С Данилом Козловским куда еще не шло-договорятся, а вот Стивен Сигал?Но если команда сможет вывести проект вперед, тогда конечно. Понаблюдаю...",delete
"  Они режиссеры им видней кого снимать.Так Стивен Сигал вроде уже старый.Больше нелеповато видеть пенсионеры типа Швацнеггера, Ван Дамма или других звезд 90-ых в новых фильмах боевиках  видеть.Кино конечно с такими актерами определенного успеха добиваеться в прокате ,но не сверх успеха по моему.",delete
"   А зачем тратить деньги на путешествия, если весь фильм можно снять в России или даже в Украине, что выйдет дешевле по бюджету? Если написано, что съемки будут в Китае и США, то это не значит, что туда на самом деле нужно ехать. Да и в чем состоит проблема чтобы пригласить Сигала? Он уже старый и его никуда не зовут сниматься.",delete
"А как по мне, то проект перспективный, ведь в кинотеатр то все ходят, да и дома есть любители посмотреть.",delete
"   1) По статистике американцы смотрят чаще те фильмы,где действие происходит в США. Так как им привычнее понять и принять внутренне сюжет основанный на родной геолокации. Погуглите для подтверждения.Это 100% достоверные данные. 2) Стивен Сигал в фильме РЕАНИМАТОР не лихой бандит. А старый, битый волк, возглавляющий банду головорезов.",delete
"   Вы наверное  поверхностно читали Whitepaper. Дело в том, что ICO REANIMATOR это не попытка собрать деньги на бюджет фантастического фильма. Деньги на это есть. А фильм уже снимается.  REANIMATOR занимается созданием кассовой платформы нового поколения CRYPTOMOVIE, внедряющей блокчейн-технологии. Платформа CRYPTOMOVIE будет обладать прозрачной структурой и множеством преимуществ по отношению к существующим сервисам онлайн и оффлайн покупки кинобилетов на рынке киноиндустрии. Главные цели нашего проекта - создание платформы CRYPTOMOVIE с автоматизированной системой на приватном блокчейне, устранение существующих проблем кассовых сборов в кино-индустрии и организация работы продажи лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE в мировом масштабе для кинопроизводителей. Мы ставим перед собой ряд задач: 1) Оптимизировать бизнес модель взаимодействия кинопроизводителя и кинопрокатчика 2) Ликвидировать высокие комиссии сетей кинотеатров за кинопрокат 3) Устранить задержки выплат кинопроизводителю 4) Усовершенствовать систему безопасности кассовых сборов 5) Обеспечить полную прозрачность сетки кассовых сборов кинофильмов путём 100% защиты от фальсификации 6) Освободить кинопроизводителей от посредников и сделать платформу CRYPTOMOVIE удобнее для всех участников сферы кинобизнеса.  Для тестирования бета версии MVP CRYPTOMOVIE, будет использоваться оригинальный фантастический фильм РЕАНИМАТОР 2018 года выпуска, производства кинокомпании ЛАМ за счет уже собранных средств на краудсейле в ноябре-декабре 2017 . Интернациональная команда REANIMATOR - многопрофильные специалисты из стран: США, Германия, Россия и Китай.   P.S.

  Дедушку Сигала пригласить будет еще куда проще чем Козловского!) в штатах это просто бизнесс...макака тимати вон без особых проблем со снуп догом снимается.... а по теме вообще проект странноватый..куда только блокчейн не пытаются прикрутить...может запустим ICO по децентрализованной анонимной оплате платных туалетов?)  я наверное сейчас кому-то обалденную идею подкинул),delete
"   Цель ICO REANIMATOR -  не жонглировать крутыми актерами в главных ролях тестового фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, а  создание платформы CRYPTOMOVIE для  прозрачности данных о кассовых сборах. Главная проблема в том, что часто владельцы киносетей или частных кинотеатров укрывают от производителей фильмов, истинную сумму кассовых сборов, уменьшая их реальный объём. Причина- данные о количестве проданных кинобилетов централизованы и могут быть легко изменены прокатчиком при желании. В Китае власти даже были вынуждены утвердить 1 марта 2017 года  специальный закон, предусматривающий суровое наказание владельцам киносетей за предоставление фальшивых данных о кассовых сборах в кинотеатрах. Смотрите статью об этом по ссылке:    По данным статьи, точный подсчет продаж билетов имеет первостепенное значение для оценки подлинного рынка кинобизнеса Китая и обеспечения здорового развития отрасли,  говорит в интервью Рен Жонглун,  президент Shanghai Film Group.  P.S. Но насколько мы понимаем, такой взрослый уровень обсуждения оригинальных идей блокчейна Вам пока трудно осмыслить. По всей видимости Вам более понятна и близка по уровню эрудиции-  идея платных туалетов на блокчейне. Успехов Вам, уважаемый.",delete
"Не понимаю, если цель ICO -создание блокчейн платформы, для чего вообще снимать этот фильм, тем более с каким-то сомнительным сюжетом? Нельзя запустить любой, уже снимающийся, в качестве пилотной версии, а сэкономленные деньги вложить в разработку платформы? А то так действительно создаётся впечатление, что ребята себе на путешествие собирают...",delete
"   1) Сюжет не сомнительный. Сюжет четкий, ясный и понятный. Прочитайте  Whitepaper. Хотя не совсем понимаю что Вы имеете в виду под словосочетанием ""сомнительный сюжет фильма"" в данном контексте. Сюжет фильма бывает или хороший или плохой. Третьего не дано. 2) Зачем просить чужих авторов дать свой художественный фильм для тестирования блокчейн платформы CRYPTOMOVIE? Если можно снять свой, протестировать его в формате MVP в рамках технологии CRYPTOMOVIE  и заодно заработать крупную прибыль инвесторам после кассовых сборов фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР.  Судя по Вашей логике все люди на Земле должны брать автомобили в аренду, а не покупать их. А зачем?  Ремонтировать не надо и  поменять машину можно бесплатно в любой момент. 3) Осенью-зимой 2017 на первом раунде ICO REANIMATOR собрано 2.673.249  USD. Если бы ребятам нужно было, как Вы выразились, просто отдыхать, веселиться и путешествовать - Вы думаете им не хватило бы для весёлого путешествия двух миллионов долларов?",delete
Кстати недавно в новостях было что Сигала обвинили в изнасиловании. Как с ним согласятся работать актеры на площадке особенно женщины?,delete
  Очень любопытное замечание с Вашей стороны...Даже если бы это было правдой (а это ложь)- как Вы себе представляете изнасилование Стивеном Сигалом всех женщин на съемочной площадке фильма РЕАНИМАТОР? Эта статья-  утка. Чтобы  вымогать взятку с киноактера. Он взятку не дал. И поэтому вышла эта фальшивка. Вердикт: не верьте всему что пишут.,delete
"Иногда на нашей ветке и вообще в других социальных сетях мы замечаем от анонимных пользователей странную критику всего нового, включая наш кинопроект на блокчейне ICO REANIMATOR. Эти люди не любят когда хвалят что-то новое, когда этим прогрессом восхищаются. Эти люди не понимают ВО ЧТО сейчас трансформируется мировая киноиндустрия, благодаря блокчейну , с сотнями миллиардов долларов ежегодных оборотов.   Также как когда-то вначале не понимали  Николу Тесла, Альберта Эйнштейна или Стива Джобса.     Мы, дружная и сплоченная команда амбициозных специалистов ICO REANIMATOR, делаем большое дело. Перед нами стоит задача изменить всю индустрию мирового кинопроката, трансформировать ее в нечто великое и абсолютно новое, чего мир еще никогда не видел. Нам предстоит конкурировать с такими агентами дистрибьюторами в России как Централ Партнершип, КАРО, Двадцатый век ФОКС в России, США и Китае, Paramount, Universal, Disney. Все эти гиганты- — морально и физически древние динозавры, но имеющими большую аудиторию, годы на формирование сообщества и наработку связей. Но мы гордые, молодые и уверенные в себе команда кинорежиссеров, программистов, инженеров и продюсеров, амбициозных менеджеров и простых упорных работяг, каждый талант в своем деле, твердо верим в нашу общую супер-идею-блокчейн платформу CRYPTOMOVIE  и знаем что рано или поздно нас ждет неизбежный успех. Мы прекрасно осознаем, что эта борьба будет непростая и...тяжёлая...И если бы у нас не было ресурсов жесткой силы воли и настроя, вряд ли мы бы ее осилили. Однако, популярность ICO дает нам возможность привлечь достаточно средств чтобы побороться за рынок и занять на нем лидирующее место. Поэтому мы организовали этот краудсейл ICO REANIMATOR, за счет которых не только соберем нужные деньги, но и привлечем внимание прессы и создадим свое сообщество, которое будет нам и помогать и поддерживать в этом противостоянии.    P.S. Никогда не нужно цепляться за прошлое. Нужно идти вперед. Несмотря ни на что и вопреки всему.",delete
   Дыма без огня не бывает. Значит были какие-то попытки и теперь у актера испорчена репутация. Теперь ему быть только в роли плохого бандита которого уничтожат в конце фильма.,delete
"  Странно пишете, кто там кого будет насиловать в сверх людном месте на съемочной площадке, даже преступники орудуют в темноте без свидетелей как правило.Да и сверх богатый актер может нанять кучу проституток себе или содержанок.То какие-то слухи не понятные.",delete

"Что такое блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE и для чего она нужна?    CRYPTOMOVIE- это блокчейн-платформа созданная специально для кинокомпаний, киностудий и продюсерских центров. CRYPTOMOVIE предназначена для установки в кассы кинотеатров для предотвращения фальсификаций суммы кассовых сборов. С помощью приложения CRYPTOMOVIE любой желающий сможет купить онлайн билет на любой кинофильм в любом кинотеатре, где предустановлена блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE. С помощью CRYPTOMOVIE любой кинопроизводитель и любой желающий сможет проверить онлайн в сети блокчейн сколько билетов продано на любой фильм с разделением по: странам, городам, сетям кинотеатров. CRYPTOMOVIE — это экосистема, формирующаяся компаниями в мире киноиндустрии.  С появлением каждого нового кинотеатра, подключенного в экосистеме CRYPTOMOVIE, криптовалюта RNM будет становиться популярнее и востребованнее, что повышает ликвидность и, соответственно, ее цену.  CRYPTOMOVIE — это очень удобно, быстро и настолько просто, что даже ребенок может купить онлайн кинобилет за минуту, а любой администратор кинотеатра подключить API кассы к платформе CRYPTOMOVIE. Это самая доступная и демократичная блокчейн платформа в мире киноиндустрии, разрушающая барьеры между кинопроизводителями и кинопрокатчиками, избавляющая своих пользователей от бюрократии и ограничений, навязанных устаревшими, закостенелыми системами подсчета кассовых сборов. CRYPTOMOVIE — это свобода создавать свое настоящее и будущее нам самим, прямо здесь и сейчас.  P.S. Приложение CRYPTOMOVIE также будет доступно для скачивания с декабря 2019 - в Play Market для операционных систем Windows, Android  и  IOS.",delete

"ПОЧЕМУ МИР КИНОИНДУСТРИИ СЕГОДНЯ ОСТРО НУЖДАЕТСЯ В НОВЫХ БЛОКЧЕЙН ТЕХНОЛОГИЯХ, ПОДОБНОЙ CRYPTOMOVIE ?    Правдивый и точный подсчет о количестве проданных билетов - сегодня большая проблема для кинопроизводителей. Говорить о реальной статистике заполняемости кинозалов невозможно, так как единой системы учета не существует: каждый кинотеатр сам посылает прокатчику свои данные. Блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE автоматически запишет в сеть  своего приватного блокчейна  точные данные по каждому фильму - цена кинобилета, когда и где продан, сколько кинобилетов продано. За лицензию CRYPTOMOVIE мы будем вместе с вами, инвесторами, получать 2 % от доходов за все проданные кинобилеты. Первый покупатель 5-летней лицензии платформы CRYPTOMOVIE в 2019 году - Китайская Госкорпорация China Film Group.  Смотрите также статью в журнале РИА НОВОСТИ, подтверждающие данные о том, что воровство с кассовых сборов фильмов и их искусственное занижение имеют серьёзную проблему в России и СНГ.   P.S. Ранее мы упоминали что 1 марта 2017 года, власти Китая, из-за бессилия применить какой-либо учет кассовых сборов, ввели суровые наказания сетям кинотеатров за фальсификацию данных о кассовых сборах.

"СРАВНЕНИЕ КОНКУРЕНТОВ    Чем блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE будет отличаться от обычной  системы подсчета кассовых сборов?

Так, чтобы кинопроизводитель не получил всю заслуженную сумму от сборов за свой фильм. В блокчейн платформе CRYPTOMOVIE эти данные невозможно  фальсифицировать. Б) У всех указанных дистрибьютеров нет открытого исходного кода для аудита своего онлайн API в кассах кинотеатров.  В блокчейн платформе CRYPTOMOVIE этот код будет открыт для доступа любым желающим на  В) У всех указанных дистрибьютеров данные о кассовых сборах централизованы и не записываются в блокчейн.

"ЛИЦЕНЗИЯ CRYPTOMOVIE НА 40 ТЫСЯЧ КИНОТЕАТРОВ КИТАЯ    Напоминаем всем сомневающимся и потенциальным инвесторам о перспективах развития платформы CRYPTOMOVIE на приватном блокчейне. После успешного тестирования фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, в рамках выявления багов платформы CRYPTOMOVIE, в 12 кинотеатрах Евросоюза - хедж-фондом CRISSE будет подписан уникальный контракт на 5 лет . Речь идёт о контракте на продажу 5-летней лицензии использования платформы CRYPTOMOVIE с китайской Госкорпорацией China Film Group. Платформа CRYPTOMOVIE  будет интегрирована онлайн в 40 тысяч кинотеатров Китая, в систему API касс кинотеатров, до конца 2022 года. Условия использования лицензии платформы CRYPTOMOVIE - 2% с продаж кинобилетов.  P.S. Просим учесть что после выкупа у инвесторов токенов RNM в декабре 2018, они не потеряют свою ценность и не станут бесполезными, как это ошибочно полагают некоторые неосведомленные потенциальные инвесторы. Токены RNM ERC20 будут обладать  бесконечной ценностью.  Причина: для продажи кинобилетов  и соответствующей децентрализованной записи данных о продаже в приватный блокчейн, кассами кинотеатров будут использоваться ТОЛЬКО  токены RNM стандарта ERC20.",delete
"   А что вы предлагаете сделать подарки каждому участнику баунти? Сначала нужно принести реальную пользу для проекта, а потом уже думать о подарках.",delete
"   Если ""Токены RNM ERC20 будут обладать  бесконечной ценностью"", то что в будущем будет с RNM токенами на платформе WAVES, помимо их выкупа согласно whitepaper?  Обмен RNM WAVES на  RNM ERC20 не планируете в будущем ?",delete
выгоды для инсвесторов конечно пока не вижу. и на данный момент такой проект запускать в России еще рановато.,delete
"   Если внимательно ознакомиться с проектом, то можно увидеть, что платформа начнет свой запуск в Китае, а не в России.",delete
  После каждого выкупа токенов RNM на платформе Waves  в декабре 2018 и в декабре 2019- они будут навсегда сохранены за хедж-фондом CRISSE и более не станут выставляться на продажу ни на один онлайн ресурс.,delete
"Бесконечную ценность сохраняют только токены RNM ERC20. Дело  в том, что кинобилет в китайский кинотеатр можно будет также купить и за фиат(например за юань). Однако, при оплате кинобилета, касса каждого кинотеатра в Китае, будет онлайн конвертировать 2% фиатных денег в токен RNM ERC20. Таким образом данные о продажах будут систематически записываться в приватный блокчейн CRYPTOMOVIE и естественным путём сохранять и планомерно повышать рыночную стоимость токенов RNM ERC20.  А соответствующая комиссия за лицензию CRYPTOMOVIE - 2% автоматически будет поступать на банковский аккаунт хедж-фонда CRISSE. Соответственно из общих полученных фиатных средств (как описано в Whitepaper) от продажи кинобилетов- 30% прибыли получают холдеры токенов RNM ERC20.",delete

"ПОЧЕМУ ДЛЯ КИНОПРОЕКТА РЕАНИМАТОР НУЖНЫ ТОКЕНЫ И ПРИЧЁМ ЗДЕСЬ БЛОКЧЕЙН?    Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР не привлечения инвестиций в бюджет фильма (бюджет давно сформирован и собран). Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР – создание ВПЕРВЫЕ В МИРЕ прозрачной сетки БЮДЖЕТА и ДОХОДА от кинопроката любых фильмов – платформы CRYPTOMOVIE на приватном блокчейне.   Что это значит? Кроме собранных  инвестиций на краудсейле 26.02.2018-26.03.2018, также после кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, 40% прибыли будет потрачено на создание специальной запатентованной технологии блокчейна –CRYPTOMOVIE.   CRYPTOMOVIE позволит обезопасить создателей любых будущих кинопроектов (кинокомпании, студии и продюсерские центры) от махинаций и подтасовки результатов  суммы сборов от кинопроката любого фильма на международном рынке. Например, если на фильм АВАТАР Джеймса Кэмерона  официально было продано билетов в мире на сумму свыше 700 миллионов долларов, то не официально эта сумма достигает свыше 1,5 миллиардов долларов. Почему? Потому что кинотеатры «прячут» 20-50% количества проданных билетов и доказать эту фальсификацию невозможно. Чтобы исключить махинации в этом  кинопрокатном секторе - все онлайн и оффлайн заказы кинобилетов будут размещаться через платформу CRYPTOMOVIE.  Внутри платформы CRYPTOMOVIE в качестве формы оплаты услуг используется собственный токен - RNM. RNM будет единственной формой оплаты. Приобретать токен RNM кинозрители смогут на платформе со встроенным API сервиса быстрого обмена популярных криптовалют по биржевому курсу. Токен RNM также будет доступен на криптовалютных биржах, и у пользователей будет возможность совершить прямой перевод на собственный CRYPTOMOVIE кошелек в своем пользовательском аккаунте. Для пользователей, незнакомых с криптовалютами, будет возможность легко приобретать RNM  по биржевому курсу за фиатные средства, используя сторонний сервис. Все данные таким образом, о количестве и цене проданных билетов навсегда оседают в приватной блокчейн платформе CRYPTOMOVIE без возможности как-либо изменить их.  В случае самостоятельной онлайн покупки кинобилета за RNM, эту информацию система  CRYPTOMOVIE автоматически  передаёт по зашифрованному каналу в онлайн дата-центр соответствующего кинотеатра, где покупатель, в зависимости от его желания - или получает классический билет на бумажном носителе по первому запросу в кассе кинотеатра  при предъявлении QR-кода, или предъявляет этот QR-код контролёру со сканером  в момент входа в кино-зал. Также, в случае больших очередей у кассы кинотеатра или отсутствия возможности онлайн-оплаты кино-билета за RNM, в холле любого кинотеатра будет размещён специальный мини-терминал по продаже кинобилетов за  криптовалюту RNM,  с использованием наличных фиат-денег. Терминалы онлайн-продажи кино-билетов во всех кинотеатрах будут размещать или сами кинотеатры или независимые владельцы за 0,1% вознаграждения от каждого выкупленного билета через их терминал. Итог: все данные о количестве выкупленных билетов на тот или иной фильм невозможно подделать так как хранятся на блокчейн-платформе CRYPTOMOVIE.  Таким образом, кинопроизводителя невозможно обмануть. Кинопроизводитель получает ровно столько денег от кинопроката, сколько было продано билетов (в соответствии с индивидуальными условиями процентного разделения доходов от продажи кино-билетов с каждой сетью кинотеатров).",delete

Спасибо заранее за ответ.",delete
"Каждый токен REANIMATOR Waves  также будет выкуплен!   Уважаемые холдеры токенов Reanimator на платформе Waves. Доводим до Вашего сведения что у Вас нет повода для беспокойства в связи с проведением  28 февраля 2018, завершающего раунда краудсейла ICO REANIMATOR на платформе ETHEREUM, путем распродажи лимитированной эмиссии 10 миллионов токенов RNM ERC20. . Ваши токены REANIMATOR стандарта Waves, также будут безоговорочно выкуплены у вас в декабре 2018 года, после кинопроката фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР.

"    Стриминговый сервис, например тот же ОККО, после получения от Вас фиатных денег за подписку, возьмёт оттуда 2% и перечислит  эту сумму в адрес Хедж-фонда CRISSE.

Таким образом происходит запись данных  о цене и сроке подписки  в распределенный реестр приватного блокчейна CRYPTOMOVIE, на основе которой ведут свою бухгалтерию владельцы производители фильмов. Однако, что касается Вашего вопроса, если Вы на стадии распродажи токенов RNM ERC20 не покупали их, а покупали уже потом, допустим через год, на криптовалютной бирже, то Ваша выгода будет только в одном: Дисконт на подписку 10-30% (в зависимости от срока подписки) от сервиса ОККО, если Вы расплатились не фиатом, а токенами RNM.",delete

"CRYPTOMOVIE ВЫХОДИТ НА Play Market    В середине 2019 года, планируется установка блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE на сервис Google Play Маркет. Продажа приложений на  Google Play Маркет с помощью CRYPTOMOVIE  станет выгодна правообладателям приложений, фильмов, игр и книг для Android. В магазине приложений компании Google, позволяющем владельцам устройств с операционной системой Android устанавливать и приобретать различные приложения, покупать или брать напрокат фильмы, игры и книги, будет таким образом доступна запись всех  данных на нашем приватном блокчейне. Сейчас руководством Хедж-Фонда CRISSE ведутся активные переговоры с представительством GOOGLE  в США о форме сотрудничества в этом направлении. Большинство приложений в Google Play создается не Google, а сторонними разработчиками. Они же отвечают за поддержку пользователей и исправность приложений. Мы рекомендуем разработчикам и компании GOOGLE использовать приватную блокчейн-платформу CRYPTOMOVIE для полной записи данных о всех онлайн-транзакциях  покупок  приложений. Таким образом, разработчики приложений, владельцы фильмов, игр и книг смогут вести 100% прозрачную бухгалтерию по статистике о количестве и сумме продаж своих IT-продуктов, а сервис Google Play Маркет  - быть более выгодным для использования в глазах клиентов, по сравнению с централизованными конкурентами, так как станет децентрализованным. Данные этой статистики через блокчейн-платформу CRYPTOMOVIE,  разработчики приложений  и владельцы фильмов, книг и игр, смогут получить онлайн в любой момент- МГНОВЕННО, без какой-либо возможности фальсификации. Условия сотрудничества между Хедж-Фондом CRISSE и компанией GOOGLE один из двух вариантов: 1) Хедж-Фонд CRISSE заплатит GOOGLE до 10.000.000 USD (за счет дополнительных трёх крупных инвесторов) за право установки блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE на сервис Google Play Маркет и тогда  получит 2% дохода от всех продаж приложений. 2) Бесплатная установка блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE на сервис Google Play Маркет и тогда Хедж-Фонд CRISSE получит 0,5 %  дохода от всех продаж приложений.

Повторяем: токены RNM выкупаются за 30% прибыли.  Это указано в Whitepaper. .,delete
"  Если не понимаете, то для начала хотя бы почитайте Whitepaper ICO REANIMATOR. Там детально описано почему именно блокчейн.    Вот короткая выдержка оттуда:  ПОЧЕМУ ДЛЯ КИНОПРОЕКТА РЕАНИМАТОР НУЖНЫ ТОКЕНЫ И ПРИЧЁМ ЗДЕСЬ БЛОКЧЕЙН?  Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР не привлечения инвестиций в бюджет фильма (бюджет давно сформирован и собран). Главная цель проведения ICO РЕАНИМАТОР – создание ВПЕРВЫЕ В МИРЕ прозрачной сетки БЮДЖЕТА и ДОХОДА от кинопроката любых фильмов – платформы CRYPTOMOVIE на приватном блокчейне.   Что это значит? После кинопроката фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, 40% прибыли будет потрачено на создание специальной запатентованной технологии блокчейна –CRYPTOMOVIE.   CRYPTOMOVIE позволит обезопасить создателей любых будущих кинопроектов (кинокомпании, студии и продюсерские центры) от махинаций и подтасовки результатов  суммы сборов от кинопроката любого фильма на международном рынке. Например, если на фильм АВАТАР Джеймса Кэмерона  официально было продано билетов в мире на сумму свыше 700 миллионов долларов, то не официально эта сумма достигает свыше 1,5 миллиардов долларов. Почему? Потому что кинотеатры «прячут» 20-50% количества проданных билетов и доказать эту фальсификацию невозможно. Чтобы исключить махинации в этом  кинопрокатном секторе - все онлайн и оффлайн заказы кинобилетов будут размещаться через платформу CRYPTOMOVIE.

"CRYPTOMOVIE- ДОЛОЙ ФАЛЬСИФИКАЦИЮ КАССОВЫХ СБОРОВ В КИТАЕ    Некоторые читатели и инвесторы, иногда сомневаются вообще в необходимости технологии блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE. Не видят в ней смысл. Для них, мы хотели бы показать что сегодня Китай испытывает большие проблемы с фальсификацией кассовых сборов в кинотеатрах.  Недавно даже утвержден новый закон, предусматривающий суровое наказание владельцам кинотеатров за сокрытие сумм кассовых сборов. Именно для исправления этой проблемы в Китае (и затем на его примере в других странах), и создана блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE. Читайте статью об этой проблему в Китае по ссылке ниже:    По предварительным переговорам между Хедж-фондом CRISSE и Китайской Госкорпорацией China Film Group, блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE будет внедрена сроком на 5 лет в 40 тысяч китайских кинотеатров в период 2019-2021 года.

"CRYPTOMOVIE ВМЕСТЕ С  SAMSUNG SMART TV    В начале 2019 года, после успешного тестирования фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР с интеграцией блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE, в 12 кинотеатрах Евросоюза, планируется немедленное внедрение блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE  в сервис Samsung Smart TV. Технология Samsung Smart TV объединяет телевизор, мультиформатный файловый плеер и предоставляет доступ к интернет-сайтам, различным сервисам и приложениям. Приложения при этом могут быть предустановленными, или загружаться из интернет-магазина Samsung Apps прямиком с телевизора. Интеграция SAMSUNG SMART TV с блокчейн-платформой CRYPTOMOVIE позволит бухгалтерии правообладателей контента получать онлайн мгновенную и правдивую статистику своих продаж в сервисе SAMSUNG SMART TV, без возможности фальсификации.  Сам сервис SAMSUNG SMART TV станет таким образом на порядок опережать своих централизованных конкурентов, имеющих подобные сервисы. Сегодня Хедж-фонд CRISSE ведет активные переговоры в этом напрравлении с компанией Samsung. Условия сотрудничества: 2% от всех продаж контента на Samsung Smart TV за 5-летнюю лицензию блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE. Токены RNM ERC20 будут таким образом использоваться внутри SAMSUNG SMART TV для взаиморасчетов между компанией SAMSUNG и Хедж-фондом CRISSE, а также покупателями контента SAMSUNG SMART TV для частичной оплаты функций  сервиса, например годовой или месячной подписки.",delete

   1) Нет это не римейк фильма 85 года. 2) Если кассовые сборы фильма РЕАНИМАТОР  будут плохими- ничего страшного для инвесторов ICO REANIMATOR.

"ПОЧЕМУ ТОКЕНЫ RNM  БУДУТ ДОРОЖАТЬ И ПОЧЕМУ ОНИ СЛУЖЕБНЫЕ    Децентрализованная блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE будет обладать рядом преимуществ перед централизованной  базой данных:  Неизменяемость; Безопасность; Резервное копирование; Снижение издержек; Подотчётность и прозрачность.  Привязанные  к блокчейн-платформе CRYPTOMOVIE токены RNM будут использоваться для взаиморасчетов между покупателями и продавцами  внутри соответствующих сервисов:  1) Кассы кинотеатров 2) Сервис Samsung Smart TV 3) Сервис Play Market  2% от суммы покупки за фиат, будут уходить на онлайн-транзакацию покупки токенов RNM на криптовалютных биржах (на выбор любая по желанию администрации сервиса)  с целью записи данных о продаже в приватный блокчейн. Таким образом это позволяет правообладателям фильмов и контента вести бухгалтерию и заниматься бизнесом прозрачным образом (например для отчетов в налоговые органы), освобождая от необходимости доверяться противоположной стороне. А токены RNM соответственно выполняют служебную функцию сервиса 100% достоверной статистики. Как известно,  ценность служебных токенов определяется популярностью и пользой сети — например, объёмом данных, которые размещаются в блокчейне, а также объёмом обрабатываемой информации. В итоге: чем больше продаж контента внутри сервисов Samsung Smart TV и Play Market, а также кинобилетов в кинотеатрах  - тем выше становится ценность токенов RNM.",delete

Это решение принято 15 февраля 2018 руководством Хедж-Фонда CRISSE и кинокомпанией ЛАМ. Речь идет о двух фондах:  1) Благотворительный фонд помощи детям с онкогематологическими и иными тяжелыми заболеваниями «Подари жизнь». Учрежден 26 ноября 2006 года актрисами Диной Корзун и Чулпан Хаматовой.   Задачи фонда: • Сбор средств на лечение и реабилитацию детей с онкологическими и гематологическими заболеваниями; • Помощь онкологическим и гематологическим клиникам, где лечатся дети и молодые взрослые; • Привлечение общественного внимания к проблемам больных детей; • Содействие развитию безвозмездного донорства крови; • Оказание социальной и психологической помощи больным детям; • Содействие работе волонтерских групп при детских онкогематологических клиниках. По словам главы государства Владимира Путина, фонд «Подари жизнь» помог многим детям справиться с онкологией.  2) Благотворительный фонд ""Центр помощи беспризорным детям ТПП РФ"" Некоммерческая организация Благотворительный фонд «Центр помощи беспризорным детям» ТПП РФ учреждён по инициативе видных деятелей науки и культуры нашей страны Торгово-промышленной палатой Российской Федерации в марте 2002 года. Cоздание фонда получило личное одобрение В.В. Путина. Возглавил Фонд Президент ТПП РФ, академик РАН Е.М.Примаков. В настоящее время Президентом Благотворительного фонда «Центр помощи беспризорным детям» является Сергей Николаевич Катырин, президент ТПП РФ. Задачи фонда: • Адресная социальная поддержка детям, находящимся в социально опасном положении (трудной жизненной ситуации); • Подготовка и реализация благотворительных программ в интересах детских учреждений, в которые направляются выявленные беспризорные и безнадзорные дети, дети-сироты и дети, оставшиеся без попечения родителей; • Содействие  деятельности в сфере профилактики и охраны здоровья детей, физической культуры и спорта, пропаганды здорового образа жизни, укрепления престижа и роли семьи в обществе.  -zhizn.ru  ",delete

Если фильм РЕАНИМАТОР не окупит себя на кассовых сборах, то на поддержку бюджета для выкупа токена Reanimator Waves придут средства от продажи лицензии блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE. Ежегодный оборот кинопроката в Китая, по официальной статистике, не менее 3 миллиардов USD.

Еще можно можно сделать немного монтажа, как в немецком ""Беги, Лола, беги"" (фильм, кстати, завоевал множество наград) - когда экран ненадолго разделяется на несколько частей. Т.е. монтаж и подача должны быть на первоклассным инновационном уровне, только так этот фильм сможет сравниться (а может и превзойти) голливудские фильмы, при этом не раздувая бюджет. Это просто болезнь российской фантастики - при куда как меньшем бюджете, чем в Голливуде, создатели копируют общую схему голливудского фильма - типа скучных ""Защитников"", которые получили разгромные отзывы не только из-за слабых спецэффектов, а именно из-за наслоения клише и отсутствия оригинальности в подаче.",delete
"  Добрый день! По поводу якобы ролика фильма РЕАНИМАТОР...Мы не меньше 100 раз отвечали на этот вопрос. Даже  устали повторять снова и снова. Но что же делать. Раз публика просит...Напомним снова:  Надо уметь отделять мух от котлет. Что такое ролик или так называемый трейлер фильма? Ролик (трейлер) фильма это концентрат того, что уже снято в рамках фильма в виде коротких динамичных сцен с наложением звуковой дорожки. Между тем, на сайте  размещен не ролик фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, и даже не трейлер. Это ТИЗЕР фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Тизер, выходит задолго до релиза основного продукта и предназначен для создания заинтересованности в нём со стороны потенциальной аудитории путём создания интриги, загадочного сообщения, которая непосредственно не указывает на сам продукт. Иными словами, тизер призван дать понять зрителю (а в нашем случае инвестору) потенциал фильма и его базовую суть в виде короткой сюжетной линии. В мае-июне 2018 выйдет уже полноценный масштабный трейлер фильма РЕАНИМАТОР с нарезками из основных уже отснятых сцен в России,Китае и Германии, с применением сложных компьютерных спецэффектов Лондонской студии ILM. Вердикт: Тизер делается до съёмок фильма и поэтому по тизеру недопустимо оценивать качество фильма. Трейлер делается  после съёмок фильма, с участием главных актёров ( в  фильме РЕАНИМАТОР- Стивена Сигала и Данилы Козловского), и по нему уже тогда можно адекватно  судить о качестве будущего фильма.

Речь идёт об облачном децентрализованном хранении огромных объёмов файлов художественных фильмов, предназначенных кинокомпаниями для проката в сетях кинотеатров во всём мире. Сегодня каждый кинотеатр любой фильм для проката у себя- скачивает по специальной кодированной ссылке от кино-производителя с облачного хранилища таких компаний как Dropbox, Amazon S3 и Google Drive. Однако,благодаря взаимодействию CRYPTOMOVIE и SIA, кинопроизводители смогут это делать в 10 раз дешевле. Sia – это проект, который предлагает частную децентрализованную и безопасную облачную платформу хранения, размещенную на блочной цепочке, за цену в 10 раз дешевле чем у конкурентов (около $ 2,25 / TB в месяц). Основная идея заключается в том, что вместо аренды хранилища от центрального банка серверов, как и в случае с традиционными облачными платформами, сверстники на платформе Sia арендуют пространство друг от друга через свою «платформу распределенного облачного хранилища».

Тестирование CRYPTOMOVIE пройдет в феврале 2019 в 12 кинотеатрах Евросоюза, с помощью производства и проката фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, с эпизодической ролью Сатоши Накамото (съемки с главным героем в Лас-Вегасе, США).  Платформа CRYPTOMOVIE обладает прозрачной структурой и множеством преимуществ по отношению к существующим сервисам онлайн и оффлайн покупки кинобилетов на рынке киноиндустрии. Наша задача - освободить кинопроизводителей от посредников и сделать платформу CRYPTOMOVIE удобнее для всех участников сферы кинобизнеса. Для тестирования бета версии MVP CRYPTOMOVIE., будет использоваться оригинальный фантастический фильм РЕАНИМАТОР 2018 года выпуска, производства кинокомпании ЛАМ за счет уже собранных средств на краудсейле в ноябре-декабре 2017.

По условиям контракта, ICO REANIMATOR и программную разработку блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE, проводит эстонский Хедж-Фонд CRISSE. Российская кинокомпания «ЛАМ» по контракту с CRISEE. займется производством фантастического триллера РЕАНИМАТОР для тестирования MVP продукта CRYPTOMOVIE и его последующей продаже лицензии на 5 лет Китайской Госкорпорации China Film Group. При помощи технологии Lighting Network, после полного старта CRYPTOMOVIE, в декабре 2019, токены RNM будут напрямую и мгновенно обмениваться на фиат и между другими криптовалютами без участия бирж почти с нулевой комиссией.   В начале 2019, по дорожной карте ICO REANIMATOR,  планируется внедрение блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE в стриминговые сервисы потокового лицензионного видео: iTunes, Netflix, Okko, Amazon Prime, Амедиатека, Ayyo, ivi.ru.  А в середине 2019 -   внедрение блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE в сервис Play Market  для ведения правообладателями контента онлайн прозрачной бухгалтерии по суммам продаж приложений для  операционных систем Android и Windows. Сразу после появления зашифрованной интернет-сети на протоколе WEB 3.0 все данные платформы CRYPTOMOVIE, внутри официального сайта, по плану команды ICO REANIMATOR, перейдут в сеть WEB 3.0.  C 20 февраля 2018 - токены RNM (Reanimator Coin) ERC20 уже доступны внутри криптовалютного мобильного кошелька Edge (в прошлом Airbitz Wallet). ICO REANIMATOR решает проблемы богатых и бедных. 1) Богатые крупные корпорации в лице Samsung, Google Play Market, Apple смогут поднять свой престиж за счет блокчейна, а мировые кинопроизводители - увеличить свои прибыли, за счет внедрения технологии блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE, предотвращающей фальсификацию данных о сумме продаж. 2) Бедные люди, которые не хотят переплачивать за кинобилеты или подписку на стриминговые сервисы видео контента, смогут сэкономить за счет приобретения токенов RNM. Например оплатить кинобилет в кинотеатре или подписку на Netflix можно будет частично токенами RNM . Токены RNM ERC20 кино-проекта ICO REANIMATOR уже можно купить за наличные евро, на кассах сети более 10 тысяч фирменных магазинов, аптек, сотового оператора и супермаркетов Германии- Real, REWE, PENNY, Budni, Ludwig, Eckert, Adams, ONExpress, и Barbarino.  Для покупки за наличные токенов RNM ERC20, покупателю достаточно предъявить на кассе магазина специальный штрих-код (BarCode) прямо на экране своего Смартфона и оплатить наличными покупку токенов RNM ERC20. После оплаты в течение 3-5 минут токены RNM ERC20 становятся автоматически доступными на балансе MEW покупателя. Известный в Европе и мире,  кинорежиссер  Руслан Магомадов, планирует привлечь культового каскадера Бена Кука главным постановщиком и исполнителем трюков в съёмках фантастического фильма РЕАНИМАТОР на территории США. Бен кук работал каскадером в таких фильмах, как: ""Властелин колец"", ""Александр"" (дублер Тобби Кеббела), Также на главные роли в РЕАНИМАТОРЕ планируется привлечь Данилу Козловского и Стивена Стигала.  ICO REANIMATOR  совершит обратный выкуп токенов RNM за 30% прибыли от кассовых сборов фильма РЕАНИМАТОР в декабре 2018. А также дополнительно еще за 30% прибыли от продажи лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE в декабре 2019.  До 3 марта 2018 инвесторы имеют право на скидку 50% на токены RNM (Reanimator Coin).  2 % от сборов на ICO REANIMATOR будет безвозмездно пожертвовано детям, оставшимся без родителей для благотворительного фонда «Центр помощи беспризорным детям», а также в благотворительный фонд помощи детям с онкогематологическими и иными тяжелыми заболеваниями «Подари жизнь».

Планировалось вообще изначально по оптимистичным прогнозам свыше 1000 кинотеатров для тестирования.

С помощью внедрённой в кассу смарт-контракту CRYPTOMOVIE, из этой суммы 2% тратятся онлайн на покупку токена RNM ERC20 (условие продажи лицензии CRYPTOMOVIE ) на криптовалютной бирже Livecoin или  YOBIT  (в будущем с помощью Lighting Network без участия бирж). Таким образом происходит мгновенная запись в блокчейн Эфириум благодаря смарт-контракту CRYPTOMOVIE о стоимости кинобилета, дате его покупки и названию фильма. Далее, бухгалтерия кинопроизводителя имеет таким образом прозрачную сетку о суммах своих кассовых сборов (в данном случае в Китае), без возможности фальсификации (как это пока, к сожалению, происходит часто в китайских кинотеатрах). А токены RNM ERC20 таким образом автоматически дорожают в цене так как повышается их популярность? благодаря кассовым сборам  фильмов в кинотеатрах. В свою очередь покупатель кинобилета будет иметь право на частичную скидку цены на билет, если он использует для оплаты часть в виде токенов RNM ERC20.  ",delete

"СКОЛЬКО БУДУТ СТОИТЬ ТОКЕНЫ ICO REANIMATOR ПОСЛЕ КАССОВЫХ СБОРОВ ФИЛЬМА?    Холдеры токенов RNM ERC20 и REANIMATOR WAVES нас часто спрашивают каким образом будет распределяться между ними первая прибыль от кино-проекта ICO REANIMATOR после кассовых сборов фильма РЕАНИМАТОР. Особенно это актуально если не будут проданы все токены RNM ERC20.  Объясняем более подробно: Вся прибыль от кассовых сборов фильма РЕАНИМАТОР, в размере 30%, будет равномерно распределена между всеми холдерами токенов RNM ERC20 и REANIMATOR WAVES.  Причем пропорция токенов REANIMATOR WAVES к  токенам RNM ERC20 будет учитываться в размере 1:10. Например продано 3 миллиона токенов. Кассовые сборы = 30 миллионов USD. 30% от кассовых сборов = 9 миллионов USD. Цена токена = 9 миллионов/3 миллиона=3 USD.",delete
"СКОЛЬКО БУДУТ СТОИТЬ ТОКЕНЫ ICO REANIMATOR ПОСЛЕ ПРОДАЖИ ЛИЦЕНЗИИ CRYPTOMOVIE?    Нам также часто приходят на корпоративную почту вопросы инвесторов о том, как будет  формироваться ценообразование токенов ICO REANIMATOR после старта продаж в 2019 году,в Китае, лицензии блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE. Цена токенов RNM ERC20 и REANIMATOR Waves будет формироваться за счет 30% прибыли от 2%  кассовых сборов всех фильмов в кинотеатрах Китая (условия предварительной договренности между хедж фондом CRISSE и Китайской госкорпорацией China Film Group). Причем соотношение REANIMATOR Waves к токенам RNM ERC20 будет 1:10. Пример: На руках у холдеров 3 миллиона токенов ICO REANIMATOR. Минимальный оборот кассовых сборов в кинотеатрах Китая, по статистике на 2016 год = 5 миллиардов USD. 2% от этой суммы= 100 миллионов USD. Прибыль хедж фонда CRISSE= минус 30% амортизация (налоги, взносы и зарплаты)= 70 миллионов USD. 30% от 70 миллионов USD= 21 миллион USD. Цена 1 токена ICO REANIMATOR в 2019 = 21 миллион/3 миллиона = 7 USD. Данная цена учитывает только продажи в Китае. После распространения и внедрения блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE в другие страны, цена 1 токена ICO REANIMATOR  будет соответственно увеличиваться в геометрической прогрессии.  P.S. Напоминаем что наша разработка - блокчейн-платформа CRYPTOMOVIE создаётся с целью исключения фальсификации по кассовым сборам фильмов в любых кинотеатрах. Технология интеграции CRYPTOMOVIE с API кассами кинотеатров будет происходить легко и быстро.  ",delete

Младший Данила после школы и армии ВДВ, стал алкоголиком от неразделенной любви и наркоманом. Старший Андрей закончил отлично МГУ и стал успешным биологом в Московском институте генетики. Андрей мечтая спасти жизнь брата создал сыворотку Омега, меняющую ДНК человека. В результате усиливается на 100% сила воли человека и появляется внутреннее отвращение ко всему, что вредит организму. Но Андрея убивают неизвестные и сжигают его в доме вместе с двумя маленькими детьми и женой. В убийстве Андрея полиция обвиняет младшего брата Данилу. Данила живующий на свалке на окраине Москвы вместе с кучкой бомжей и наркоманов получает от курьера ключ от ячейки банка. В банке он достаёт из ячейки новый паспорт с его фотографией, на чужие имя фамилию, шприц с Омегой и завещанием брата ввести инъекцию внутривенно. На второй день Данилу тошнит от вони, грязи и мусора. Он бросается в реку и начинает тщательно мыть все тело и одежду. Уходит со свалки. Начинает учить специальные книги в библиотеках. Находит работу грузчиком на заводе. Изучает на ютюбе кунгу-фу,бокс,айкидо,карате и самостоятельно тренируется на улице. Постигает успешно основы гипноза. Читает онлайн-книги в интернете  о способах тренировки мозга для улучшения памяти, образного мышления и скорости реакции. Уезжает жить и работать в Китай, торговый город Гуанчжоу. Влюбляется в сотрудницу местной  библиотеки. Женится. Растит с супругой двух сыновей. Открывает крупный бизнес. Проходит 10 лет. Становится миллионером.  Тело и разум Данилы путём годов ежедневных многочасовых тренировок доведены до совершенства.  Чувство мести за жестокое убийство брата и его семьи тихо тлеет в его сердце. Заплатив тайно китайской лаборатории в НИИ, Данила получает через год - 4 порции сыворотки Омега. Возвращается в Москву. Даёт Омегу своим старым 4 знакомым: наркоманам и бомжам,тем самым реанимирует их.  Вместе с новой командой улетает в США, Лас-Вегас. Там, находятся на недельном отдыхе все заказчики и банда исполнителя казни семьи брата...  P.S. Концовка фильма РЕАНИМАТОР - это настоящая интрига.

"P.S. Ранее, мы отказались от услуг криптовалютной биржи HOTBIT затребовавшей у Хедж-фонда CRISSE чрезмерно завышенную цена за листинг = 15 Биткоинов ( 15 BTC).     Вот апетиты у акул - пускай теперь сидят без REANIMATOR ,можно ведь всегда найти общие решения - и не надо сразу загибать цену  ,Я думаю HITBIT очень даже хорошо для старта пойдёт ,я поддерживаю !!",delete
"  жалко менеджера, хотя такие моменты нужно замечать сразу, тем более, если это его работа. а насчет hotbit, кстати, верное решение. слишком жирно платить 15 битков за листинг бирже с оборотами как у йобита.",delete

   Давно ошибку то нашли?  10 дней все-таки новость провисела. Может как-то стоит изменить тот пост? Не все же такие внимательные.,delete
"Подскажите, листинг на биржу HitBTC, не планируется? Или все равно будет добавлена на эту биржу?",delete
   Отменяется. Потому что мы с толкнулись с аферистами. Листинг будет как планировалось на: 1) Hotbit.io 2) Livecoin  Сегодня листинг токенов REanimator Waves и RNM ERC20 уже есть на: 1) Dex Waves 2) Ehherdelta,delete

     А в чём смысл? Зачем дампить цену таким образом? Что на это говорят текущие инвестора проекта? Или это предвестие скорого закрытия проекта?,delete
"  смысл в том, чтобы срубить деньжат. а на инвесторов, похоже, наплевать. потому что одно дело сделать бонус в 20%, и совсем другое в 1000%. сразу напомнило хайпы с огромными бонусами к первому депозиту. как по мне это очень сомнительная маркетинговая акция, которая ни на какие хорошие мысли не наталкивает.",delete
"   Не преувеличивайте. Это обычная скидка на часть нераспроданного актива. Чтобы привлечь большее внимание к проекту Так делают в бизнесе периодически. Например - сети супермаркетов, автосалонов и т.д. Это нормально.",delete
"Скидка 90% В магазинах обычно так делают когда скоро истечет срок реализации товара или его уже несколько лет не могут продать, что значительно ухудшает внешний вид. Только для ICO этот способ совсем непригоден.",delete
"  Хорошо сказано, тут такая же ситуация похоже, разрабам больше токены не нужны, пытаются продать кому нужен, в других проектах их вообще-то сжигают. Что-то мне кажется у проекта отставание по дорожной карте намечается.",delete
"  Предложение получить в 10 раз больше очень щедрое, как бы не случилось чего плохого. Сейчас просто так никто и ничего не даст, есть смысл подумать дважды.",delete
"   Не надо строить в своём воображении искусственные страхи, основываясь на сравнении абсолютно несовместимых продуктов. Посмотрите хотя бы один из 1000 примеров, на магазин игр PS Store- там также бывают скидки раз-два в год до 90%.  И причем зачастую на топовые игры, такие как GTA-5 или Call of Duty. Напоминаем, что токены RNM ERC20 - это цифровой актив, а не скоропортящиеся помидоры или картошка, которые как Вы здесь помянули, нужно скорей продать, пока они вообще не пропали.  И не забывайте что это не ВЕЧНАЯ АКЦИЯ, а ОГРАНИЧЕННАЯ НА 24 ЧАСА.  Было бы глупо, если бы Вы, как хозяин продуктового  магазина, сегодня продавали помидоры по 10 рублей, а завтра по 100 рублей. Вердикт: Токены кино-проекта РЕАНИМАТОР - твёрдый инвестиционный продукт, нацеленный в будущее, на обслуживание сети кинотеатров.",delete
"  Отставание только по дорожной карте съёмочного процесса Х/Ф РЕАНИМАТОР. И оно не критическое.  Между тем самый главный момент - по дорожной карте создания блокчейн-платформы CRYPTOMOVIE, всё идёт по графику и даже с небольшим опережением.",delete

"Ну, что есть какие то изменения, после, на мой взгляд, вашей ""утки"" про листинг на хит бтц? это же надо такую сказку то придумать. что фонд попался на договоренность о листинге от мошенников. буд то ни знаете где ведутся договоренности о листингах........ ИМХО плевок в лицо криптосообществу",delete
   Изменения по поводу чего Вы имеете в виду?,delete

"  Листинг в наше время это неоправданно дорогое удовольствие, пора бы понять сие. Отвыкайте уже от листингов своих. Как-то и без них проекты в свет выходят))))",delete
"          Это отличная новость. Хотелось бы также узнать, когда монета выйдет на биржи и мы сможем ими торговать.",delete
"  похоже действительно на сбор бабла с такими скидками, или админам срочно на море нужно уехать отдохнуть вот и решили по быстрому собрать",delete
  Так можно торговать на дельте. Только кто их будет покупать,delete
"  90 % это конечно сильно. Так и представляю реакцию более ранних инвесторов. Согласен, что это выглядит как распродажа ""просрочки""",delete
"Нестандартный подход к ICO. Вызывает интерес, однозначно. Но время сейчас непростое, в наши дни инвестора в лесу с фонарями ищут. А у вас далеко не самая популярная отрасль, ни блокчейн, ни биржа... Может быть изменить маркетинговое направление в сторону более простых людей, а тут «акулы») Я бы лично эфира лучше б подкупил, не в обиду. В общем довольно интересно все выглядит.",delete
"  это плевок в лицо тем, кто покупал раньше, и совершенно неуместные примеры этого не изменят. получается, что ранние инвесторы автоматически получают сразу минус несколько иксов, потому что те, кто купил со скидкой постараются продать при первой возможности получить прибыль. ну и сказки насчет твердого инвестиционного продукта тоже просто слова. сейчас даже биток и эфир на роль твердых не тянут, хотя в них инвестировано уже очень много. и это факт, в отличии от туманных перспектив с сетью кинотеатров.",delete
"   НЕ преувеличивайте. Это нормальная практика продвижения популярности продукта в маркетинге в любом бизнесе. Например, если товар в сети магазинов продают 1 раз в год со скидкой 90%- разве это значит что магазин плохой и плюёт в лицо тем, кто купил этот товар по базовой цене?",delete

"   Улыбнуло. Действительно, зачем эти листинги?! Хватит и одной дельты. Похоже стоимость токена, команду не особо интересует, особенно при таких распродажах.",delete
"  Наоборот команда пытается додоить остатки с доверчивых новичков. Я ничего кроме тотальных распродаж и массового падения цены токена не вижу. И какие-то новости, ни на что не влияющие, лишь бы показать что проект якобы жив...",delete
"Просто интересно, тем кто купит билеты за эфир - будут бесплатно эквивалентно потраченной сумме давать токенов RNM. Зачем это проекту? Это значительно увеличит кол-во зрителей?",delete
"ну что ребята! как там ваше ""кино""? что-то прям тишина у вас, никаких интригующих новостей, прям как в настоящих русских скамах проектах, которые набирают капу и улетают на острова, а монету кладут глубоко на дно",delete
"  а они хоть чтото собрали? это же каким наивным надо быть, что инвестировать в этот скам ) Кино млять на блокчейне, обычное кино уже не устраивает, нужно крипту сюда присобачить)",delete
"  типа еще во время пресейла собрали 2,5 ляма. но мы уже давно не верим в подобного рода сказки. одно дело, когда можно хотя бы проверить поступление средств на адрес (да и то, накрутки возможны и в таком случае). другое дело вообще просто на слово верить.",delete
"Разработчики либо решили покорить рынок, за счет нестандартного подхода и таким образом будут продавать токены, пока все не продадут. Либо это некая хитрость",delete
"Раз продажи кино-билетов на фильм РЕАНИМАТОР идут, можно предположить, что съемки закончатся вовремя? Раньше как то больше было новостей про фильм.",delete
  Да с такой биржай как дельта далеко не уйдёшь. А так идея команды довольно интересная и как вижу продвигается по немного в такое сложное время для ICO стартапов. Пожелаю Вам только удачи .,delete
"   Идея интересная, но продвижения нет. ICO продлили на 1 год до 5 сентября 2019, так что и бирж соответственно пока не будет.",delete
"  Еще на год Давайте снимать кино без блохчейна и токенов кому реально интересно получить качественный продукт, а не тратить время и деньги на проведение ICO.",delete
"Да и на 50 лет продлят, лох не мамонт, он не вымрет.",delete
"   Они собирают не только на научно-фантастический фильм РЕАНИМАТОР, а хотят создать еще блокчейн-платформу CRYPTOMOVIE.",delete
серьезно? на год? а кто то собирался в конце 2018 года выходить на биржи) или передумали? видел я пару таких проектов...затянули/продвинули на год все сроки...по итогу....ничего не сделали,delete
"  Да тут сразу было ясно, что это за проект. А когда они начали ""всего полдня"" начислять какие-то невиданные бонусы за покупку, все сомнения развеялись сразу. И я не говорю, что это скам. Может фильм когда-то увидит свет. Вот только каким этот фильм будет это вопрос.",delete
"Ну,надеюсь фильм получиться хорошим,а то мало ли,скажется ещё на всей компании и ICO) А так идея действительно прикольная и не похожая на остальные,очень интересно,что из этого получиться",delete
Хороший проект) все новые и новые идеи в нашем мире   криптовалют . хорошо что все идет вперед .,delete
"  Только неизвестно в каком году это произойдет Вон Гинзбург реально снимает фильм. Пусть без крутых спецэффектов и зарубежных локаций, но ребята работают над продуктом и получают инвестиции.",delete
"То, что продлили на год, как-то невесело. Ждали целый год реализации проекта, а тут еще один год. Но все-таки, кажется, что сделают фильм. Инвесторы вроде хорошие, и актеры.",delete
"  Это был 90% бонус) Не знаю, что думали разработчики, но инвесторы поняли это как крик о помощи и реальный интерес людей к этому проекту После этого продление продаж на год меня не удивляет)",delete
  Такие сдвиги в сроках просто не серьезно. Не уже ли они надеются и верят что такое решение пойдет на пользу проекту. Данные закидоны хороши для того чтобы про проект забыли и похоронить его.,delete
было бы не плохо . я люблю кино ) я бы инвестировал в данный проект . и сам бы помогал . в развитии.,delete
"Есть фильмы, которые и по пять лет снимают, сейчас вышел в кинопрокат кукольный фильм, который снимали семнадцать лет, там прям художественное произведение искусства. А тут плюс ко всему  биржу свою собираются запилить. Пусть работают, может что и выйдет из этого",delete
"  Сейчас тренд продливать ико ,  банти и релизы . Дорожная карта походу просто картинка . Почему бы не закладывать риски сразу в дорожную карту ,  такие как даунтренд рынка .",delete
"   Вы на форуме хоть появляйтесь и что-то пишите, а то уже больше трёх месяцев новостей нет, хотя уже наверно и не будет.",delete
"вот уже плюс еще один месяц без новостей. а ведь поначалу я хотел верить, что очередной проект из реального сектора все таки сможет выстрелить с помощью ico. хотя почти все указывало на обратное. тут с самого начала команда проекта активно отбивалась от нападок скептиков. оказалось, что это была просто игра на публику.",delete
"  да ага появятся они, уже скоро месяц будет как профиль даже на форум не заходил, наверное очень занят сьемками))) а по факту просто смысла уже нет заходить сюда и что то писать",delete
"  Да уж, как-то печально все, прям не оправдали надежд. Тишина гробовая по всем инстанциям. Видимо опять деньжат собрали иии извините, не получилось, аривидерчи( Мне казалось, что именно этот проект должен показать, что не каждое второе ико обычный баблосбор и что кинематограф у нас еще огого",delete
"  2018 год - это год разочарование во многих проектах, я тоже заходил изредка в эту тему и почему то была надежда на то что кино все таки снимут и реально получится хороший проект, но видимо моя надежда меня подвела в этом году.",delete
"   Да они и ничего не собрали, кошелёк пустой почти на нём копейки лежат. Кинокомпания LAM новый трейлер на ютубе выложила, может новое ICO скоро увидим. ",delete
"   Так может они что то снимают, а мы просто не в курсе?))сообщество киноманов которое здесь собралось)) или решили переключить свое внимание и внимание инвесторов на что то другое. Думаю снять они могут только какую то  трагикомедию по своему сценарию.",delete
"  ага а когда баблосбор шел что то они в первую очередь к сообществу, которое собралось тут, обращались и писали, и новости разного рода делали и все для сбора бабок а сейчас?",delete
"  Начинали превосходно. И также превосходно затаились. Возможно ожидают лучшего момента для реализации своей идеи. Ну или решили отдохнуть от ""проделанной"" работы? В общем похоже кина не будет. Кризис.",delete
"  Писал я естественно с сарказмом, понятное дело, что обещаний было вагон и тележка как всегда, а кина по ходу точно что не будет, по ходу и денег на него уже тоже нет, возможно и команда разбежалась кто куда. А мы тут что то обсуждаем)",delete
"  Я думаю, если бы что-то делалось, то явно была бы инфа хоть какая, не исключаю факта нового ико из серии ""ну попробовать-то стоило"". Или да, будет трагедия - ну не смогла, не смогла( Вроде бы неплохо все и выглядело, достаточно уверенно, но по итогу крах",delete
"  Согласен с тем, что если бы положительные новости были, они бы регулярно публиковались.",delete
"Очнитесь, какое наф кино на блокчейне, кому это может быть интересно? Что либо делать и создавать видимость работы совсем разные вещи.",delete
"  Ну вы не правы. -na-ico-kak-ekranizatsiya-romana-pelevina-empire-v-vernula-veru-v-kraudsejly-i-russkie-filmy/ Вон по Пелевину почти закончили съёмки с привлечением ICO, а реаниматор мусорный скам, я прав?",delete
"  тоже зашел в этот топик, чтобы озвучить эту новость, а меня уже опередили. как раз вчера вечером прочитал эту статью га фьлкоге и воодушевился. во-первых, я люблю пелевина, и не откажусь увидеть очередную экранизацию его произведения. ну а во-вторых, сейчас люое успешное ico ценно само по себе. а то инвестор уже начинает терять веру в них.",delete
  интересно а вы действительно верите в проект чью подпись носите? или тоже вам сказать очнитесь?) почему собственно нельзя было реализовать то что было изначально запланировано?,delete
"Увидел знакомое название, и вспомнил, что год назад они обещали, что в конце 2018 все мы озолотимся, они выкупят наши токены, и наступит безбедная жизнь )) Помню, еще на волнах первое ICO делали. Почитав тему понял, что не нужно пока спешить искать доступы к кошельку Waves, богатство пока откладывается ",delete
"Так и не нашел новой информации по проекту, есть ли новости, может кто-то списывался с админом. Хотя наверное это бестолку. Участвовал в баунти и держу токены, а теперь они не кому не нужны.",delete
"давно не встречал эту темку, а помница мне, что они такие дифирамбы пели о свом фильме. хотя судя по ролику тогда, то следовало ожидать, что на ролику все и закончится.",delete
"Не появилась ли информация от создателей, может быть кто-то состоит с ними в переписки? Или все проект закрыт осталось помахать рукой и оставить свои надежды о продажи токенов?",delete
